'''BBC One''' is a [[Television in the United Kingdom|British]] [[free-to-air]] television network owned and operated by the [[BBC]], which operates a [[public television]] service. It is the corporation's [[Flagship (broadcasting)|flagship]] network, and is known for broadcasting mainstream programming, including [[BBC News]] television bulletins, primetime drama and entertainment, and some sports events.

It was launched on 2 November 1936 as the '''BBC Television Service''', and was the world's first regular television service with a high level of [[image resolution]].<ref>It used the Marconi-EMI [[405-line]] all-electronic television service and, for the first three months, the Baird 240-line [[intermediate film system]]. Germany introduced television with a medium level of image resolution (180 lines) in 1935, initially based on intermediate film, but fully electronic by 1936.</ref> It was renamed '''BBC TV''' in 1960, using this name until the launch of the second BBC channel, [[BBC Two|BBC2]], in 1964, whereupon the main channel became known as '''BBC1''', with the current spelling of '''BBC One''' adopted in 1997.

The channel's annual budget for 2012–2013 was £1.14&nbsp;billion.<ref name="Service licence">{{cite web|url=http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/bbctrust/assets/files/pdf/regulatory_framework/service_licences/tv/2012/bbc_one_nov12.pdf|title=BBC One Service Licence|publisher=BBC Trust|date=November 2012|access-date=17 May 2013}}</ref> It is funded by the [[television licence]] fee together with the BBC's other domestic [[television station]]s, and shows uninterrupted programming without commercial advertising. It is currently{{when|date=June 2021}} the most watched television channel in the United Kingdom, ahead of its traditional rival for ratings leadership, [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]].{{citation needed|date=June 2021}}

Controller of BBC One since 2013, [[Charlotte Moore (TV executive)|Charlotte Moore]], became BBC's Chief Content Officer on 3 September 2020, joining the BBC Board in the process and becoming the senior creative lead for the corporation's content and audiences apart from the news, nations and regions.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2020/charlotte-moore|title=Charlotte Moore appointed to BBC Board| publisher=BBC Media Centre. 3 September 2020 | access-date=3 September 2020}}</ref>

The BBC began its own regular television programming from the basement of [[Broadcasting House]], London, on 22 August 1932. The BBC Television Service officially began regular broadcasts on 2 November 1936 from a converted wing of the [[Alexandra Palace]] in London.<ref>{{cite book|first=R.W.|last=Burns|title=Television: An International History of the Formative Years|location=London|publisher=The Institution of Electrical Engineers|year=1998|pages=ix|isbn=0-85296-914-7}}</ref>

On 1 September 1939, two days before Britain declared [[World War II|war]] on Germany, the station was taken off air with little warning, with the last programme to be shown being a [[Mickey Mouse]] cartoon (the 1933 short [[Mickey's Gala Premier]]);<ref name=MickeyMouse>{{cite web|url=http://www.transdiffusion.org/emc/baird/tvoff/index.htm |title=The edit that rewrote history – Baird |access-date=28 May 2007 |publisher=Transdiffusion Broadcasting System |date=31 October 2005 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060125014953/http://www.transdiffusion.org/emc/baird/tvoff/index.htm |archive-date=25 January 2006 }}</ref> the government was concerned that the VHF transmissions would act as a beacon to enemy aircraft that could bomb London.

BBC Television returned on 7 June 1946 at 15:00. [[Jasmine Bligh]], one of the original announcers, made the first announcement, saying, "Good afternoon everybody. How are you? Do you remember me, Jasmine Bligh?" The same Mickey Mouse cartoon that was shown in 1939 was repeated twenty minutes later.<ref>

===Creation of BBC1===
The BBC held a statutory [[monopoly]] on television broadcasting in the United Kingdom until the first [[Associated-Rediffusion|Independent Television station]] began to broadcast on 22 September 1955, when [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] started broadcasting. The competition quickly forced the channel to change its identity and priorities following a large reduction in its audience.

The 1962 [[Pilkington Committee on Broadcasting|Pilkington Report]] on the future of broadcasting noticed this, and that ITV lacked any serious programming. It therefore decided that Britain's third television station should be awarded to the BBC.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sixtiescity.com/Television/BritishTV.htm |title=British Television up to the end of the Sixties |publisher=Sixtiescity.com |access-date=12 September 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071024020910/http://www.sixtiescity.com/Television/BritishTV.htm |archive-date=24 October 2007 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>

The station, renamed BBC TV in 1960, became BBC1 when [[BBC Two|BBC2]] was launched on 20 April 1964 transmitting an incompatible [[576i|625-line image]] on UHF. The only way to receive all channels was to use a complex "dual-standard" 405- and 625-line, VHF and UHF, receiver, with both a VHF and a UHF [[Television antenna|aerial]]. Old 405-line-only sets became obsolete in 1985, when transmission in the standard ended, although standards converters have become available for enthusiasts who collect and restore such TVs.

BBC1 was based at the purpose-built [[Television Centre, London|BBC Television Centre]] at [[White City, London]] between 1960 and 2013. [[BBC News#1950s|Television News]] continued to use Alexandra Palace as its base—by early 1968 it had even converted one of its studios to colour—before moving to new purpose-built facilities at Television Centre on 20 September 1969.

In the weeks leading up to 15 November 1969, BBC1 unofficially transmitted the occasional programme in its new colour system, to test it. At midnight on 15 November, simultaneously with [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] and two years after BBC2, BBC1 officially began 625-line [[PAL]] colour programming on UHF with a broadcast of a concert by [[Petula Clark]].<ref>[http://www.halifaxcourier.co.uk/news/50-still-watch-black-and.5818157.jp 50 still watch black and white TV in Calderdale] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091115113349/http://www.halifaxcourier.co.uk/news/50-still-watch-black-and.5818157.jp |date=15 November 2009 }} ''Halifax Courier'', 12 November 2009</ref> Colour transmissions could be received (in monochrome) on monochrome 625-line sets until the end of analogue broadcasting (and indeed can still be received if such a set is connected to a [[digital television adapter]] tuned to the [[Standard-definition television|SDTV]] version of the channel.)

In terms of audience share, the most successful period for BBC1 was under [[Bryan Cowgill]] between 1973 and 1977, when the channel achieved an average audience share of 45%.<ref>{{cite web|title=BRYAN COWGILL|url=http://www.transdiffusion.org/tv/tvheroes/bryancowgill|publisher=transdiffusion.org|access-date=2 June 2014}}</ref> This period is still regarded by many as a golden age of the BBC's output, with the BBC achieving a very high standard across its entire range of series, serials, plays, light entertainment and documentaries. {{original research inline|date=June 2014}}

On 30 December 1980, the BBC announced their intention to introduce a new [[breakfast television]] service to compete with [[TV-am]]. The BBC stated it would start broadcasting before TV-am, but made clear their hands were tied until November 1981 when the new licence fee income became available, to help finance extending broadcast hours, with the hope of starting in 1982.  On 17 January 1983, the first edition of ''[[Breakfast Time (British TV programme)|Breakfast Time]]'' was shown on BBC1, becoming the first UK wide breakfast television service<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/breakfast/presenters/7706825.stm |title=Programmes &#124; Breakfast &#124; Presenters &#124; The Evolution of Breakfast |work=BBC News |access-date=1 February 2014}}</ref> and continued to lead in the ratings until 1984.<ref>{{cite news |title=TV-am takes peak breakfast ratings lead |work=The Times |date=27 August 1983}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=BBC regains lead in breakfast TV ratings |work=The Times |date=17 September 1983}}</ref>

===Michael Grade era (1984–1987)===
In 1984, [[Bill Cotton]] become managing director of Television at the BBC, and set about overhauling BBC1, which had been slated for poor home grown shows, its heavy reliance on US imports, with ''[[Dallas (1978 TV series)|Dallas]]'' and ''[[The Thorn Birds (TV miniseries)|The Thorn Birds]]'' being BBC1's highest rated programmes and ratings being over 20% behind ITV. Cotton recruited [[Michael Grade]] to become Controller of BBC1 from 1 September 1984<ref>Top job for Grade at BBC 1: The Times (London, England), Thursday, 31 May 1984</ref><ref>Early-evening ratings war likely if BBC replaces 'Sixty Minutes. Hewson, David The Times (London, England), Wednesday, 6 June 1984, p.3.</ref> the first time the corporation had recruited someone outside of the BBC,<ref>{{cite news |title = Top job for Grade at BBC 1|work = The Times|date = 31 May 1984|page = 1}}</ref> replacing Alan Hart, who has been criticised for his lack of knowledge in general entertainment, as he was head of BBC Sport prior to 1981.

The first major overhaul was to axe the unpopular ''[[Sixty Minutes (UK TV programme)|Sixty Minutes]]'' current affairs programme: this was a replacement for the news and magazine show ''[[Nationwide (TV programme)|Nationwide]]''. Its replacement was the ''[[BBC News at Six|BBC Six O'Clock News]]'',<ref>{{cite news |work=The Times |date=6 June 1984 |page=3 |issue=61850}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=BBC goes for news to replace Sixty Minutes flop |last=Chorlton |first=Penny |work=The Guardian |date=9 June 1984}}</ref> a straight news programme in a bid to shore up its failing early evening slot. It was believed the BBC were planning to cut short the evening news and move more light entertainment programming in from the 18:20 slot, but this was dismissed. The [[Miss Great Britain]] contest was dropped, being described as verging on the too offensive after the January 1985 contest, with ''Worlds Strongest Man'' and ''International Superstar'' also being cancelled.<ref>{{cite news |title=BBC drops beauty show |work=The Times |date=17 November 1984 |page=3}}</ref>

BBC1 was relaunched on 18 February 1985 with a [[Computer Originated World|new look]], new programming including ''[[Wogan]]'', ''[[EastEnders]]'' and a revised schedule to help streamline and maintain viewers throughout the course of the evening. Grade started to gear most programmes to either on the hour or half past the hour, while ''Panorama'' and ''Omnibus'' were both moved after the ''Nine O'Clock News''.<ref>{{cite news |title=Battle plan that opens a new panorama |first=Peter |last=Fiddick |work=The Guardian |date=4 February 1985}}</ref> Grade was also determined to end the dated and inept BBC1 scheduling which was hampering the network and which was holding back good programmes. Grade stated "When I took over BBC1, I discovered there were wonderful things, it was just a case of where to put them." ''Wogan'' had been scheduled for a 10&nbsp;pm slot, but Grade moved it to a 7&nbsp;pm slot as he believed the show had potential.<ref name="transdiffusion.org">{{cite web|url=http://www.transdiffusion.org/tv/tvheroes/michael_grade |title=Michael Grade – Television – Transdiffusion Broadcasting System |publisher=Transdiffusion.org |access-date=1 February 2014}}</ref>

From February to August 1985, a high number of American mini-series were broadcast while filming took place of a number of new home grown programmes, including ''[['Allo 'Allo!]]'', ''[[In Sickness and in Health]]'', and ''[[Open All Hours]]''. Further improvement came about when the corporation strengthened its drama output costing £30&nbsp;million, with eight new series, including ''[[Howards' Way]]'', ''[[All Creatures Great and Small (1978 TV series)|All Creatures Great and Small]]'', ''Hold the Back Page'', and ''Bluebill'', along with the return of ''Bergerac'' and ''Big Deal''. The increase in the drama department was achieved by switching the money away from the administrative service over a three-year period, after BBC1 was criticised for failing in matching ITV's output in drama.<ref>{{cite news |title=BBC unveils £30m drama season with films galore |work=The Times |date=9 August 1985 |page=2}}</ref> ''EastEnders'' was moved to a 19:30 slot, where it managed to soar to 20 million, helping the BBC1 audience share increase to nearly 50% for the first time since 1982.

On 27 February 1985, ''[[Doctor Who]]'' was placed on an 18-month hiatus. The BBC originally planned to axe the series as they wished to spend its budgets on new programming for the channel, but was forced to back down from public pressure and Doctor Who returned in September 1986. At the time Michael Grade and Jonathan Powell were blamed for the decision (Grade was the target of death threats<ref name="transdiffusion.org"/>) but it was later revealed that the decision was taken due to the series running out of creative inspiration, making it impossible to find anyone (at the time) who knew what to do with the series.<ref>Michael Grade: On the Box – episode 5: Dishing the Dirt</ref><ref>"Trials and Tribulations" – from the DVD of ''The Ultimate Foe'' (''Trial of a Time Lord'').</ref>

On 9 September 1985, the long-standing children's programming block was overhauled and rebranded as ''[[CBBC (TV channel)|Children's BBC]]'', which gave it dedicated idents for the first time and had a live in-vision presenter, similar to rival ITV's [[CITV|Children's ITV]] block which had been running since January 1983. Previously the BBC had broadcast children's programming using BBC1's team of regular duty announcers. The launch presenter for this block, and thus the first Children's BBC presenter of the current format, was [[Phillip Schofield]].

On 23 May 1986, long-running lunchtime magazine show ''[[Pebble Mill at One]]'' was broadcast for the last time after 14 years on the air. On 27 October 1986, BBC1 launched its daytime television schedules.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://bbctimeline.appspot.com/events/agtiYmN0aW1lbGluZXIMCxIFRXZlbnQY9SMM |title=BBC Timeline – Events – LAUNCH OF DAYTIME TELEVISION SERVICE (BBC-1 & BBC-2) |work=Bbctimeline.appspot.com |date=27 October 1986 |access-date=1 February 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203000624/http://bbctimeline.appspot.com/events/agtiYmN0aW1lbGluZXIMCxIFRXZlbnQY9SMM |archive-date=3 December 2013 }}</ref> In a statement, BBC Daytime head Roger Laughton said:

{{cquote|It was the natural extension of the corporation's commitment to public service broadcasting, since half the population had access to television during the day mainly the retired, unemployed and housewives.}}

===1990s===
[[File:BBC1-1991.svg|100px|thumbnail|left|Logo of BBC1 from 16 February 1991 to 4 October 1997]]

Stereo audio transmissions, using the [[NICAM]] digital stereo sound format began on BBC1 in late 1987, to coincide with the sale of the first consumer NICAM-enabled equipment, a year after BBC2, and were gradually phased in across BBC TV output, although it took until 31 August 1991 for the service to begin officially on both channels. During this time, both commercial analogue broadcasters, [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] and [[Channel 4]] had officially begun [[Stereophonic sound|stereo]] transmissions using the BBC-developed NICAM system. Widescreen programming was introduced on [[Digital television|digital platforms]] in 1998.

For the first fifty years of its existence, with the exception of films and purchased programmes from the United States and elsewhere, almost all the channel's output was produced by the BBC's in-house production departments. This changed following the passing of the [[Broadcasting Act 1990]], which required that 25% of the BBC's television output be out-sourced to independent production companies.<ref>{{cite web|title=Who we are and how we commission|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/commissioning/tv/articles/who-we-are-how-we-commission|publisher=[[BBC]]|access-date=17 January 2016}}</ref> By 2004 many popular BBC One shows were made for the channel by independents, but the in-house production departments continued to contribute heavily to the schedule.

In March 1991, as part of the £63&nbsp;million programme package for spring and summer line up on BBC1, it was announced an extra £20&nbsp;million was to be spent on rejuvenating the channels drama and comedy output during peak times, which meant the channel would be in a healthy state once the new [[ITV (TV network)|Channel 3]] licences were awarded.<ref>{{cite news |title=£20m extra for peak-time TV |first=Melinda |last=Wittstock |work=The Times |date=13 March 1991 |page=7}}</ref>

In December 1991 ''[[Wogan]]'' was to be cancelled, due to falling ratings against a number of [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] shows, in which ''Wogan'' only managed six million viewers compared to double for ''[[This Is Your Life (British TV series)|This Is Your Life]]'', ''[[The Krypton Factor]]'' and ''[[The $64,000 Question (British game show)|The $64,000 Question]]''. Additionally an extra £40&nbsp;million a year was spent on narrowing the gap on ITV's ratings lead, since a few months prior to this the channel had been criticised for its Autumn schedule, having tired formats, uninspiring scheduling of new programmes and poor scripts.<ref>{{cite news |title=Wogan to host new shows |first=Melinda |last=Wittstock |work=The Times |date=2 December 1991 |page=2}}</ref> ''Wogan'' was replaced with ''[[Eldorado (TV series)|Eldorado]]'', in early July 1992, but this was itself cancelled a year later.

[[Alan Yentob]] launched the 1993 Autumn schedule calling it "My first try with a lot of help from my friends", with the channel still under criticism, following the start of new programming Alan introduced a year earlier and the number of summer repeats. £175&nbsp;million was spent on 80 hours of original drama produced, enchantment to the arts with an extended 26-week run for ''[[Omnibus (British TV programme)|Omnibus]]'', and documentaries with ''[[The Downing Street Years]]'', new wildlife series and an eight-month look at Sheffield's Children's hospital, while ''[[Goodnight Sweetheart (TV series)|Goodnight Sweetheart]]'', ''[[Grace & Favour]]'' and ''The Danny Baker Show'' were new comedy series.<ref>Yentob concocts dramatic recipe to lift BBC1 ratings.Alison Roberts, Arts Correspondent. The Times (London, England), Wednesday, 4 August 1993; pg. 5</ref> ''[[Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman]]'' was brought in to give the Saturday night line up a bit of variety.

Following the public disapproval of filling its schedule with 25% of repeats during the summer months in 1993, BBC1 agreed to broadcast an extra 110 hours worth of original programming over the same period during the summer in 1994, which included giving ''EastEnders'' an additional episode per week. Efficiency savings of £25&nbsp;million were found which were redeployed on the new productions. The savings were seen as a vindication so for the producer choice, the controversial market-oriented drive introduced in April 1993.<ref>{{cite news |title=£25m savings help BBC curb repeats |first=Alexandera |last=Frean |work=The Times |date=10 March 1994}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=BBC to run repeats throughout year but only by demand |first=Alexandra |last=Frean |work=The Times |date=18 September 1993 |page=3}}</ref>

By March 1999, the channel admitted defeat in its ratings war with [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]], with its Spring line up with a stronger emphasis on serious factual programmes, educations and drama. This change in strategy came about after continuing complaints that the channel was appealing to the lowest common denominator to win viewers, which has left it chastened by the hoax guests on ''[[The Vanessa Show]]'', over reliance on [[docusoap]]s and the dropping of the vilified ''[[Noel's House Party]]''. Alan Yentob said "The spring package is to remind people of what the BBC is here for, Range and ambition you won't find anywhere else at peak time". The changes help the channel distinguish itself from (as one BBC executive said) "its downmarket rival and would not compete for viewers on ITV's terms."<ref>{{cite news | title=BBC surrenders in Tv ratings war and goes back to nature |first=Carol |last=Midgley | newspaper=The Times | location=London | date=23 March 1999 | page=1}}</ref>

During Heggessey's five years in charge, BBC One's audience share fell by 19.9%, to 23%, although this was in the context of declining audience figures across all British television channels due to increased competition from multichannel [[digital television]].<ref name="first">{{cite news|url=http://news.independent.co.uk/media/article11208.ece|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071001125646/http://news.independent.co.uk/media/article11208.ece|url-status=dead|archive-date=1 October 2007|title=The first woman at the helm of BBC1 quits to go commercial|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|first=Ciar|last=Byrne|date=15 February 2005|access-date=20 January 2007}}</ref> However, in 2001 BBC One overtook its main rival [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] in terms of annual audience share for the first time since the rival channel had launched in 1955,<ref name="itv1">{{cite news|url=http://media.guardian.co.uk/bbc/story/0,,597066,00.html|title=Getting One over|first=Maggie|last=Brown|newspaper=The Guardian|format=Requires free registration|date=19 November 2001|access-date=20 January 2007}}</ref> although much of this was down to the success of the channel's [[daytime television]] line-up, which had its own Controller: [[Jane Lush]].<ref name="itv1"/>

When Heggessey arrived at the channel in November 2000, she inherited two controversial schedule changes which had been implemented the previous month, at the behest of [[Director-General of the BBC]] [[Greg Dyke]]; the ''[[BBC Nine O'Clock News|Nine O'Clock News]]'' had been moved to the later time of 22:00 and ''Panorama'' moved from a Monday night prime time slot to a later slot on Sunday nights.<ref name="panorama">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/BBC/Story/0,,383701,00.html|title=	1m viewers lost as BBC shifts Panorama to Sunday 'graveyard' slot|newspaper=The Guardian|first=Matt|last=Wells|date=17 October 2000|access-date=20 January 2007}}</ref> The moving of ''Panorama'' attracted criticism that BBC One was sidelining serious programming in favour of more populist output.<ref name="homer">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk_news/story/0,3604,626507,00.html|title=BBC scores a Homer in ratings race|first=Matt|last=Wells|newspaper=The Guardian|date=2 January 2002|access-date=20 January 2007}}</ref> Heggessey publicly defended the decision, despite it not being hers, claiming that ''Panorama'''s ratings would have "dwindled" in its previous slot.<ref name="panorama"/>

Heggessey and the BBC's Controller of Drama Commissioning, [[Jane Tranter]], took advantage of the weekday 21:00 slot opened up by the moving of the news to commission new popular drama output, such as the successful ''[[Waking the Dead (TV series)|Waking the Dead]]'' (2000–2011) and ''[[Spooks (TV series)|Spooks]]'' (2002–2011).<ref name="popular">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk_news/story/0,3604,1558384,00.html|title=BBC1 boss promises drama, not docusoaps|newspaper=The Guardian|first=Owen|last=Gibson|date=29 August 2005|access-date=20 January 2007}}</ref> Celebrity dancing show ''[[Strictly Come Dancing]]'' (2004–present) was also a popular success on Saturday nights,<ref name="popular"/> although another Saturday night entertainment series, ''[[Fame Academy]]'', faced accusations of being too derivative of the output of commercial rivals, and during Heggessey's era the channel frequently came under attack for being too populist and not providing enough serious programming.<ref name="attacks">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk_news/story/0,3604,856989,00.html|title=BBC gets serious in defence of flagship channel|first=Matt|last=Wells|newspaper=The Guardian|date=10 December 2002|access-date=20 January 2007}}</ref>

Immediately after her arrival, Heggessey ordered a review of the [[BBC One 'Balloon' idents|"Balloon" idents]] the channel had been using for its between-programe [[Television ident|idents]] since 1997. In her opinion, the balloon was "slow and distant" and so, on 29 March 2002, after much speculation, she took the decision to abandon the "Balloon" idents (and the traditional [[History of BBC television idents|"Globe" idents]] the channel had used in a variety of forms since 1963). They were replaced by a new style of on-air identity for the channel, the [[BBC One 'Rhythm & Movement' idents|"Rhythm & Movement" idents]]. The new idents attracted criticism for going against the traditions of the channel<ref name="idents1">{{cite news|title=End of the world is nigh for BBC|first=Adam|last=Sherwin|newspaper=The Times|date=27 March 2002}}</ref> and pandering to "[[political correctness]]", as they featured activities performed by people of various ethnicities.<ref name="idents2">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/Archive/Article/0,4273,4384922,00.html|title=End of the world for BBC branding|newspaper=The Observer|date=31 March 2002|access-date=20 January 2007}}</ref> The abandonment of a station clock, and perceived lack of a 'serious ident', also put the BBC in an embarrassing situation just one day into the new look with the death of the [[Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother|Queen Mother]].

One of Heggessey's most notable decisions and last major success at the channel was the recommissioning of the science-fiction drama series ''[[Doctor Who]]'', which had been a popular hit in previous decades but ceased production in [[Survival (Doctor Who)|1989]]. Heggessey and Jane Tranter recommissioned the series in September 2003, after Heggessey had spent two years persuading the BBC's commercial arm, [[BBC Worldwide]], to abandon their attempts to make a [[feature film]] version of the programme and allow it instead to return to BBC One.<ref name="who1">{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2003/09/26/nwho26.xml|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040108171020/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2003/09/26/nwho26.xml|url-status=dead|archive-date=8 January 2004|title=Doctor Who ready to come out of the Tardis for Saturday TV series|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|first=Tom|last=Leonard|date=26 September 2003|access-date=20 January 2007}}</ref> The new version of ''Doctor Who'' (2005–present) debuted on 26 March 2005 and became a critical and popular hit,<ref name="who2">{{cite web|url=http://media.guardian.co.uk/site/story/0,14173,1507679,00.html|title=Doctor Who fights on&nbsp;... and on|first=Matt|last=Wells|publisher=[[Guardian Unlimited]]|format=Requires free registration|date=16 June 2005|access-date=20 January 2007}}</ref> with [[Paul Hoggart]] of ''[[The Times]]'' newspaper describing the series as "a joyful, exuberant reinvention and a fine legacy from Ms Heggessey."<ref name="who3">{{cite news|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,14934-1541827,00.html|title=Just what the Doctor ordered|newspaper=The Times|first=Paul|last=Hoggart|author-link=Paul Hoggart|date=28 March 2005|access-date=20 January 2007}}</ref>

Heggessey did later concede in a 2005 interview with ''[[The Independent]]'' newspaper that [[The arts|arts]] programming had suffered a cutback under her control of BBC One.<ref name="swapper"/> However, she did respond to this omission following criticism from the [[Board of Governors of the BBC]] by commissioning programmes such as the arts documentary series ''[[Imagine (TV series)|Imagine...]]'' (2003–present) and ''[[A Picture of Britain]]'' (2005).<ref name="notdumb">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk_news/story/0,3604,1414747,00.html|title=BBC1 controller switches to the independent sector|newspaper=The Guardian|first=Owen|last=Gibson|date=15 February 2005|access-date=20 January 2007}}</ref>

On 14 February 2005 it was announced that Lorraine Heggessey was to leave the BBC to take up the post of Chief Executive at production company [[Talkback Thames]].<ref name="notdumb"/> She left on 15 April. Five months after her departure, BBC One was named "Channel of the Year" at the [[Edinburgh International Television Festival|Edinburgh Television Festival]], primarily on the strength of Heggessey commissions such as ''Strictly Come Dancing'' and ''Doctor Who''.<ref name="year">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/low/entertainment/4191972.stm|title=BBC wins channel of year awards|publisher=[[BBC News Online]]|date=27 August 2005|access-date=20 January 2007}}</ref>

Joining the channel as Controller in 2005, [[Peter Fincham]] oversaw the commissioning of several successful BBC One programmes including ''[[Robin Hood (2006 TV series)|Robin Hood]]'' (2006–2009), ''[[Jane Eyre (2006 miniseries)|Jane Eyre]]'' (2006) and ''[[How Do You Solve a Problem Like Maria?]]'', which was followed by similar shows ''[[Any Dream Will Do (TV series)|Any Dream Will Do]]'' and ''[[I'd Do Anything (BBC TV series)|I'd Do Anything]]'' because of its success.<ref name="snoddy">{{cite news|url=http://news.independent.co.uk/media/article1919429.ece |title=Back the BBC to hang on to its viewers in the multi-channel age |work=The Independent |first=Raymond |last=Snoddy |date=23 October 2006 |access-date=19 January 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930184232/http://news.independent.co.uk/media/article1919429.ece |archive-date=30 September 2007 }}</ref> His first full year in charge of the channel saw a year-on-year growth in the audience share, with a rise from 22.2% in August 2005 to 23.6% in August 2006.<ref name="audience">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2006/sep/18/broadcasting.mondaymediasection|title=Channel 4's Big Brother hangover|work=The Guardian|date=18 September 2006|access-date=19 January 2007}}</ref>

Fincham also directly initiated the creation of both  ''[[The One Show]]'' (2006–present), an early evening, current-affairs and lifestyle magazine programme, which now runs all but two weeks of the year, and ''[[Davina (talk show)|Davina]]'' (2006), a prime time [[chat show]], the latter hosted by [[Davina McCall]], who presented ''[[Big Brother (UK)|Big Brother]]''.<ref name="oneshow">{{cite news|url=http://media.guardian.co.uk/bbc/story/0,,1865519,00.html|title=The One Show gets another go|first=Matt|last=Wells|work=MediaGuardian|date=6 September 2006|access-date=19 January 2007}}</ref> However, ''Davina'' was a critical and ratings disaster,<ref name="davina1">{{cite news|url=http://comment.independent.co.uk/columnists_m_z/thomas_sutcliffe/article351178.ece |title=Do not blame Davina for this disaster |work=The Independent |first=Thomas |last=Sutcliffe |date=14 March 2006 |access-date=19 January 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060615233135/http://comment.independent.co.uk/columnists_m_z/thomas_sutcliffe/article351178.ece |archive-date=15 June 2006 }}</ref> which Fincham subsequently admitted was personally his fault, although he defended the strategy of experimenting with the BBC One schedule. This he continued in January 2007, when he moved the [[current affairs (news format)|current affairs]] series ''[[Panorama (TV series)|Panorama]]'' from its Sunday night slot back to the prime time Monday evening slot from which it had been removed in 2000, most likely in response to a demand from the [[Board of Governors of the BBC]] for the channel to show more current affairs programming in prime time.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://travel.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,14934-2276469,00.html|title=Panorama to take on ITV soap|work=The Times|first=Adam|last=Sherwin|date=19 January 2006|access-date=19 January 2007 }}</ref>

Fincham's judgement was again called into question, this time by ''The Telegraph'', for his decision to spend £1.2&nbsp;million replacing the channel's [[BBC One 'Rhythm & Movement' idents|'Rhythm and Movement' idents]], which had been introduced by his predecessor [[Lorraine Heggessey]] several years earlier, with the [[BBC One 'Circle' idents|'Circle' idents]], a set of eight ten-second films, some of which were shot abroad in locations such as Mexico and Croatia.<ref name="idents">{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1529890/BBC-splashes-out-1.2m-on-circle-of-life-TV-links.html|title=BBC splashes out £1.2&nbsp;m on circle of life TV links|last=Alleyne|first=Richard|work=The Telegraph|date=27 September 2006|access-date=19 January 2007}}</ref> Fincham later found himself having to publicly defend the £18&nbsp;million salary that the BBC paid [[Jonathan Ross (television presenter)|Jonathan Ross]] in 2006, although Ross's BBC One work—primarily consisting of ''[[Friday Night with Jonathan Ross]]''—formed only part of his overall BBC commitment.<ref name="ross">{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article673344.ece|title=BBC's £18&nbsp;m deal makes Ross best-paid presenter|first=Adam|last=Sherwin|work=The Times|date=10 June 2006|access-date=19 January 2007 }}</ref>

===The One to Watch campaign===

Following its rebrand in March 2002, BBC One launched ''The One to Watch'' campaign, during which animated blocks created the word "The" and moved into the [[BBC]] logo.
Each new campaign incorporating the theme retained the same animated sequence.

In May 2007, Fincham took the decision to drop ''[[Neighbours]]'', an Australian soap opera, from BBC One after 21 years on the channel, when its producers, [[Freemantle Media]] significantly raised the price they wanted the BBC to pay for it in a bidding war.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6669769.stm|title=BBC pulls out of Neighbours fight|work=BBC News|date=18 May 2007|access-date=18 May 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070528121634/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6669769.stm|archive-date=28 May 2007 |url-status=live}}</ref> Fincham commented that it was 'a big loss', but that BBC One would not pay 'the best part of £300&nbsp;million'. ''Neighbours'' left the channel after the BBC's contract to show the programme ended on the 8th February 2008, and moved to [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]] on the 11th February 2008.<ref name=NeighMove>[https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/may/19/broadcasting.bbc Bidding war sees Neighbours move house from BBC to Five] The Guardian, 19 May 2007</ref> ''[[The Weakest Link (UK game show)|The Weakest Link]]'' was moved from BBC Two to fill the gap, with the afternoon [[CBBC (TV channel)|CBBC]] slot moving 20&nbsp;minutes earlier.

There was further controversy in July 2007 when Fincham was accused of misleading BBC One viewers. The incident involved a clip from forthcoming documentary ''[[A Year with the Queen]]'' which was shown to journalists during a press conference. It apparently showed [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|the Queen]] storming out of a session with American photographer [[Annie Leibovitz]] over a disagreement about what she should wear, but the BBC subsequently admitted that the scenes used in the trailer had been edited out of their correct order, meaning that a false impression was given.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6294472.stm|title=BBC apologises over Queen clips|work=BBC News|date=12 July 2007|access-date=13 July 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070825043357/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6294472.stm|archive-date=25 August 2007 |url-status=live}}</ref> Fincham admitted the error, but rejected calls that he should resign from his position as a result.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6896892.stm|title=I stay, says royal row BBC boss|work=BBC News|date=13 July 2007|access-date=13 July 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070715170512/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6896892.stm|archive-date=15 July 2007 |url-status=live}}</ref> His future was deemed uncertain following critical comments from [[Michael Lyons (UK politician)|Sir Michael Lyons]], Chairman of the [[BBC Trust]] and he resigned on 5 October 2007.<ref>[http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/tv_and_radio/article2224732.ece BBC may 'close channels to cut costs'] ''The Times'', 9 August 2007</ref>

As part of the Delivering Quality First proposals submitted by the BBC in October 2011 and approved by the [[BBC Trust]] in May 2012, all children's programming on BBC One and Two would be moved permanently to the CBBC and CBeebies channels following the digital switchover.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-18083178 |title=Children's shows to leave BBC One |publisher=BBC |date=16 May 2012 |access-date=1 February 2014}}</ref> It was found that the majority of child viewers watched the programmes on these channels already and that only 7% of these children watched CBBC programmes on BBC One and Two only, it was made clear "Children's programmes are absolutely fundamental to the BBC and that is why we have protected investment in them in the light of cuts elsewhere."<ref name="DQF conclusions">{{cite web|title=Delivering Quality First Final Conclusions|url=http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/bbctrust/assets/files/pdf/review_report_research/dqf/final_conclusions.pdf|publisher=BBC Trust|access-date=18 May 2012}}</ref> Children's programming on BBC One ended on 21 December 2012.<ref>{{cite web|title=Children's programming comes to an end on BBC One|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-20809627|publisher=BBC News (BBC)|date=21 December 2012|access-date=21 December 2012}}</ref> The move was criticised by ''Teletubbies'' co-creator [[Anne Wood]], who described the changes as "ghettoising children's programmes" and believe it was merely a cost-cutting measure. Wood said "On the one hand it is inevitable. But it is dismissive of children. There is a certain amount of overlooking of the fact that children's programmes do get a wider audience than people are aware of&nbsp;... I have frequently had letters from older people who have enjoyed my programmes as much as children do. A lot of the reason older people like to watch children's programming is because it is life-enhancing." Head of BBC Children's, Joe Godwin said: "Our young viewers are our priority and the vast majority of children in the UK already tune in to CBeebies and CBBC to find their favourite BBC children's programmes. Far from being a 'cynical' move, we're just following where our audience has already gone."<ref>{{cite web|author=Press Association |url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2013/jan/08/teletubbies-creator-bbc-ghettoising-childrens-tv |title=Teletubbies co-creator says BBC move to digital is 'ghettoising' children's TV|newspaper=The Guardian |date=8 January 2013 |access-date=1 February 2014}}</ref>

As part of the review in 2012 other changes were brought in, including:
* BBC One is reducing the minimum hours of arts and music from 45 to 40, achieved through cutting episodes of shows, in particular [[Film 2013]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Sweney|first=Mark|title=Blue Peter and other children's shows to be ditched from BBC1|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/may/16/blue-peter-childrens-shows-bbc1|newspaper=The Guardian|date=16 May 2012}}</ref>
* BBC One and Two will "largely be protected from making significant cuts".
* Repeats on BBC One will increase, but remain under 10% of all output (the current rate is 8.4%{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}).
* Expenditure on sports rights will be cut by 15%. This had largely been achieved already by sharing rights to Formula 1 coverage from 2012 (it was later dropped entirely from 2016).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-18083178 |title=BBC News – Children's shows to leave BBC One |publisher=BBC |date=16 May 2012 |access-date=1 February 2014}}</ref>

In 2012, the BBC out-bid ITV for the rights to air a ''[[The Voice UK|British]]'' version of Dutch TV talent show ''[[The Voice (franchise)|The Voice]]''. The BBC paid £22&nbsp;million for the rights to broadcast the show in the UK for two years. ''The Voice UK'' achieved good ratings for the BBC but ratings dropped towards the end of the first series and the second series. In 2013, ''The Voice UK'' was rescheduled to avoid a clash, and as a result, ratings have improved. In November 2015, it was announced that ''The Voice UK'' would be moving to [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] from 2017, especially because of the [[ITV plc]] ownership of franchise owner, [[Talpa Network#Former assets|Talpa Media]].

'''BBC One HD''', a [[simulcast]] of BBC One in [[1080i]] [[High-definition television|high-definition]] (HD), launched on 3 November 2010 at 19:00 with ''The One Show''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2010/10_october/21/bbconehd.shtml|title=BBC One HD Channel to launch 3 November and EastEnders to go HD on Christmas Day|publisher=BBC Press Office|date=21 October 2010}}</ref> The channel simulcasts a network version of BBC One in High Definition, with HD versions of programmes including ''[[Doctor Who]]'', ''[[Holby City]]'', ''[[The One Show]]'', ''[[Strictly Come Dancing]]'' and ''[[The Apprentice (UK TV series)|The Apprentice]]''. ''[[EastEnders]]'' was also made available in HD from Christmas Day 2010. All programmes still made in standard-definition were upscaled on the channel, with the intention that by 2012 the vast majority of the channel's output would be in high-definition. On 30 May 2012{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}, the satellite and terrestrial resolution was increased to [[1080p|full HD]].

BBC One HD at launch did not offer regional variations, and therefore the channel could not broadcast during regional programming slots, most noticeably the local news programmes. The BBC Trust admitted that this was due to technical and financial constraints,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/bbctrust/news/press_releases/2010/may/hd.shtml |title=BBC One goes high definition |publisher=BBC Trust |date=28 May 2010 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> but the BBC announced on 6 June 2011 that the national variations of BBC One Northern Ireland, BBC One Scotland and BBC One Wales, would become available from 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/aboutthebbc/reports/pdf/workplan_0611.pdf|title=BBC Executive priorities and summary workplan for 2011/12|page=11|work=[[BBC Online]]|access-date=6 June 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/blogaboutthebbc/posts/Satellite-Shuffling-reducing-BBC-Red-Button-and-expanding-BBC-One-HD|title=BBC – Blogs – About the BBC – Satellite Shuffling: reducing BBC Red Button and expanding BBC One HD|last=Pryde|first=Alix|work=[[BBC Online]]|access-date=2 October 2012|archive-date=19 April 2013|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130419231841/http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/blogaboutthebbc/posts/Satellite-Shuffling-reducing-BBC-Red-Button-and-expanding-BBC-One-HD|url-status=dead}}</ref> On 24 October 2012, Northern Ireland received the first variation.

With a mission to provide programmes for all licence-fee payers, it has sport, news, current affairs, and documentaries. It has historically broadcast children's programmes (now taken from [[CBBC (TV channel)|CBBC]] and [[CBeebies]]). The channel remains one of the principal television channels in the United Kingdom and provides 2,508 annual hours of news and weather, 1,880 hours of factual and learning, 1,036 hours of drama, 672 hours of children's, 670 hours of sport, 654 hours of film, 433 hours of entertainment, 159 hours of current affairs, 92 hours of religion and 82 hours of music and arts.<ref>Selected programmes are produced in high definition and simulcast on [[BBC HD]]. {{cite web|title=BBC Annual Report and Accounts 2005/2006|work=BBC Trust|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/bbctrust/assets/files/pdf/review_report_research/bbcannualreport.pdf|page=144|access-date=28 April 2007|archive-date=21 May 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140521023502/http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbctrust/assets/files/pdf/review_report_research/bbcannualreport.pdf|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Since 1990, the BBC has had to commission output from other domestic suppliers. Although the statutory target remains 25% for independent production companies to contribute programming for BBC One, 33% of output was made by them in 2010–11.<ref name=AnnRep2010>{{cite web|url=http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/annualreport/pdf/bbc_exec_sopps_2010_11.pdf|title=Performance against public commitments|publisher=BBC Trust|access-date=18 September 2011}}</ref> The quota of original programming in peak times is set at 90%, however 100% of peak programming was original in 2010–11.<ref name=AnnRep2010/> Over the whole day, the total for the same year was 89%, against a quota of 70%.<ref name=AnnRep2010/>

2,508 annual hours of news and weather (293 in peak, 1,049 of [[BBC News]] simulcasts) are provided by regular news programmes ''The Briefing'', ''[[BBC Breakfast]]'', the ''[[BBC News at Nine]]'', ''[[BBC News at One]]'', ''[[BBC News at Six]]'' and the ''[[BBC News at Ten]]'' each including BBC regional news programmes. All three main news bulletins have a lead over their rival programmes on ITV and other terrestrial or cable channels. During the weekend period, [[BBC Weekend News|three separate bulletins]] around these three time periods are broadcast and vary in length from 10 to 25 minutes. BBC One has broadcast overnight simulcasts from the [[BBC News (TV channel)|BBC News Channel]] (which itself is simulcasting with [[BBC World News]]) since 1997; the latter in turn simulcasts the majority of all regular BBC One bulletins. When BBC One is broadcasting a BBC News special, it hands some of its daytime programming to BBC Two.

Each year 159 hours of current affairs programmes are broadcast on BBC One, including ''[[Panorama (TV series)|Panorama]]'' and ''[[Watchdog (TV series)|Watchdog]]''. Politics is also covered, with programmes including ''[[Question Time (TV series)|Question Time]]'' and ''[[This Week (BBC TV series)|This Week]]'' shown. ''[[Crimewatch]]'', a programme appealing for help in unsolved crimes, is broadcast monthly.

BBC One shows 1,880 hours of factual and learning programming annually. This includes a wide range of shows such as nature documentaries such as ''[[Planet Earth (franchise)|Planet Earth]]'' as well as lifestyle-format daytime programmes and a number of ''reality television'' formats and the ''One Life'' strand.

BBC One broadcasts 1,036 hours of drama each year, more than any other BBC channel. There are four half-hour episodes of ''[[EastEnders]]'' each week (not shown on Wednesdays), with an [[Omnibus (broadcast)|omnibus]] episode at the weekend, plus hospital dramas ''[[Casualty (TV series)|Casualty]]'' and ''[[Holby City]]''. Other popular dramas on BBC One include crime dramas such as ''[[New Tricks]]'', a programme of which even episode repeats have beaten ITV ratings on numerous occasions.<ref name=AnnRep2006>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/bbctrust/assets/files/pdf/review_report_research/bbcannualreport.pdf |title=BBC Annual Report and Accounts 2005/2006 |access-date=1 February 2014 |archive-date=21 May 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140521023502/http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbctrust/assets/files/pdf/review_report_research/bbcannualreport.pdf |url-status=dead }}</ref>

BBC One has traditionally been the home of children's television: ''[[Blue Peter]]'' had been broadcast on the channel prior to the Children's BBC strand, and sections such as the pre-school ''[[Watch with Mother]]'' being transmitted on the channel for several decades. This became more pronounced with the launch of Children's BBC, later renamed "[[CBBC (TV channel)|CBBC]]". This new strand was broadcast primarily on BBC One in the late afternoons, as well as Saturday and Sunday mornings also such as ''[[Going Live!]]'' and ''[[Live & Kicking]]'', each lasting two to three hours. The launch in 2002 of dedicated digital channels for this content —the [[CBBC (TV channel)|CBBC]] and [[CBeebies]] channels —did not affect this provision. Combined with BBC Two, the channel broadcast 2,195 hours of children's programmes in 2010, mostly in the late afternoons on weekdays.<ref name=AnnRep2010/> Saturday morning children's programming moved to BBC Two in 2006 following a three-month trial.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4549160.stm BBC mulls Saturday morning switch] ''BBC News'', 21 December 2005</ref>

Sports coverage on BBC One includes [[Premier League]] football highlights on ''[[Match of the Day]]'', [[The Championships, Wimbledon]], the [[London Marathon]], and other international [[Athletics (sport)|athletics]] and swimming events, the [[Olympic Games]], [[Rugby league]], [[Rugby Union]], [[Snooker]] tournaments, the American [[Super Bowl]], and more.

The BBC showed the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]], splitting the group stage matches with ITV. The 8 BBC had first pick of matches from the second round. Repeats made up 8.4% of peak programming in 2010–11, up from 8.0% for 2008–09.<ref name=AnnRep2010/> Programming on this channel costs an average of £162,900 per hour.

British and international films are broadcast for 654 hours each year on BBC One. This is mainly late-night fillers with some box office hits at Christmas and holiday periods.
Sometimes on a Saturday afternoon there is a film on to fill the gap between entertainment shows but very rarely has there been one in that slot.

Entertainment programming on BBC One includes game shows such as the ''[[National Lottery (United Kingdom)|National Lottery]]'', ''[[Total Wipeout]]'', ''[[Strictly Come Dancing]]'' and chat shows such as ''[[The Graham Norton Show]]''.

The annual 92 hours of religious programming comprise weekly editions of live ''[[Songs of Praise]]'', Christian services and other shows from independent production companies. Mentorn Oxford produces ''Heart and Soul'', described as "a new multi-faith programme featuring a panel and a studio audience", followed by ''Life from the Loft'' which is made by the Leeds-based company True North.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.churchtimes.co.uk/content.asp?id=38046 |title=New shows to replace Heaven and Earth |work=Church Times |date=27 April 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928030756/http://www.churchtimes.co.uk/content.asp?id=38046 |archive-date=28 September 2007 }} {{subscription}}</ref> In 2005 BBC One was criticised for reducing the amount of religious programming, previously 101 hours per year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.christiantoday.com/article/channel.governors.criticise.bbc1.for.reducing.religious.programming/2818.htm|title=BBC criticised for reducing amount of religious programmes|work=Christian Today|date=9 May 2005}}</ref>

BBC One broadcasts many comedy programmes, often on Friday nights. These have included the stand-up comedy show ''[[Live at the Apollo (TV series)|Live at the Apollo]]'', sitcom ''[[Outnumbered (UK TV series)|Outnumbered]]'', and satirical quiz show ''[[Have I Got News for You]]''.<ref>[https://www.mirror.co.uk/celebs/tv/news/2011/03/08/have-i-got-news-for-you-to-return-to-friday-nights-115875-22975235/ Have I Got News For You to return to Friday nights] ''Daily Mirror'', 8 March 2011</ref> Saturday evening is also a popular slot for a comedy show such as ''[[Michael McIntyre's Big Show]]'' and ''[[The Armstrong and Miller Show]]''.

Since [[BBC Three]] became an [[BBC Three (online)|online-only service]] in 2016, BBC One broadcast some BBC3 programming, particularly such as ''[[People Just Do Nothing]]'', ''[[Cuckoo (TV series)|Cuckoo]]'', ''[[RuPaul's Drag Race UK]]'' and ''[[This Country]]''. Since March 2019, after the News at Ten, BBC1 has had a dedicated timeslot for BBC Three, as a programming block.

As the weekly popular music chart programme ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' was dropped in 2006 (except for the Christmas Day edition), BBC One broadcast 49 hours of music and arts programming in 2010.<ref name=AnnRep2010/> The majority of this was ''[[Imagine (TV series)|Imagine]]'', presented by [[Alan Yentob]], and classical music concerts, in particular some of the ''[[BBC Proms]]''.

BBC One's daytime line-up was a major factor in it overtaking ITV as the most popular channel in 2000, a position it has retained, even though ITV achieves a higher audience share during the daytime.<ref>{{cite news|title=BBC1 daytime revamp hits BBC2 and Channel 4 ratings|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/jan/25/bbc1-daytime-tv-revamp-ratings|newspaper=The Guardian}}</ref> The morning daytime line-up consists of lifestyle shows, such as ''[[Homes Under the Hammer]]'' and ''[[Bargain Hunt]]'', the afternoons contain drama with daily soap ''[[Doctors (2000 TV series)|Doctors]]'' and classic US drama, such as ''[[Diagnosis: Murder]]''. Sometimes a drama such as ''[[Land Girls (TV series)|Land Girls]]'' is shown in the afternoons.

Between 15:05 and 17:05 was the CBeebies/CBBC broadcasting strand, with its own visual identity. Historically, BBC One's most popular daytime programme was ''[[Neighbours]]'', with audience figures approaching five million. On 11 February 2008, BBC One dropped ''Neighbours'' and the programme has since been broadcast on [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6669769.stm|title=Five wins Neighbours soap fight|access-date=10 February 2008|date=18 May 2007|work=BBC News}}</ref> In its place the quiz show ''[[The Weakest Link (UK game show)|The Weakest Link]]'', moved from BBC Two, later replaced in 2011 by ''[[Pointless]]''.

On 16 May 2012, the BBC announced the children's block of shows would be moved permanently to CBBC and CBeebies upon the completion of the Digital switchover.<ref>{{cite news|title=Children's shows to leave BBC One|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-18083178|work=BBC News|access-date=16 May 2012|date=16 May 2012}}</ref> In its place appear the game show ''[[Perfection (game show)|Perfection]]'', plus ''[[Escape to the Country]]'' and ''[[Put Your Money Where Your Mouth Is (TV series)|Put Your Money Where Your Mouth Is]]''.

[[File:BBC One circle.jpg|thumb|The BBC One 'Hippos' ident (2006–16)]]

BBC One's identity has been symbolised by a globe shown on its [[Station identification|idents]] for much of its existence.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.transdiffusion.org/emc/baird/symbol.php|title=Oh, that Symbol&nbsp;... – Baird|access-date=28 May 2007|date=1 December 2003|publisher=Transdiffusion Broadcasting System}}</ref> The first BBC ident was shown on 2 December 1953, known as the Bat's Wings. In 1962 this was replaced by a map of the UK shown between programmes, and in 1963 the globe appeared, changing in style and appearance over the next 39 years.

Most notably, on 18 February 1985, the "[[Computer Originated World]]" was introduced. This was a computer-animated globe with the land coloured gold and the sea a transparent blue, giving the impression of a glass globe. This was replaced by the "[[BBC One 'Virtual Globe' ident|Virtual Globe]]" on 16 February 1991. On 4 October 1997, the globe became a [[BBC One 'Balloon' idents|red, orange and yellow hot-air balloon]], coloured to resemble a globe. It was filmed flying around various places in the UK.

On 29 March 2002, the globe was replaced by a series of visual identities, "idents", consisting of people [[BBC One 'Rhythm & Movement' idents|dancing in various styles]]. These were replaced on 7 October 2006 by the [[BBC One 'Circle' idents|'circle' idents]]. According to the BBC, the circle symbol both represents togetherness (unity) and acts as a link to the classic globe icon used for 39 years.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2006/09_september/26/idents.shtml|title=BBC ONE launches new channel identity |date=26 September 2006|publisher=BBC|access-date=18 September 2011}}</ref> They ran until 4 December 2016, when that year's Christmas idents launched.

In England,<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/england England] BBC</ref> each region has an individual [[:Category:BBC Regional News shows|regional news]] and current affairs programme opt-out as well as a limited amount of continuity. During these opt-outs, the region name is displayed as with the national variations, beneath the main channel logo.{{According to whom|date=April 2020}} ''[[UK Today]]'', a news programme, was shown nationally to digital viewers in place of regional programmes when they were unavailable to broadcast on analogue television. The programme was discontinued in 2002 and replaced by a transmission of ''[[BBC London News]]'' until all BBC regions were made available digitally.

[[BBC One Scotland]] has the greatest level of variation from the generic network, owing to [[BBC Scotland]] scheduling Scottish programming on the main BBC Scotland channel, rather than on [[BBC Two]].
BBC One Scotland variations include the soap opera ''[[River City]]'' and the football programme ''[[Sportscene]]'', the inclusion of which causes network programming to be displaced or replaced.

[[BBC One Wales]] was considered a separate channel by the BBC as early as its launch in the mid-1960s, appearing as BBC Wales.<ref>''"...&nbsp;a separate service – BBC Wales – available to the greater part of the people in the Principality&nbsp;..."''

BBC One (Northern Ireland) is widely available in the [[Republic of Ireland]] on [[Cable television in the Republic of Ireland|cable]] and satellite television. BBC One (especially the London feed) is also available on cable and [[IPTV]] in the [[Netherlands]], [[Belgium]], [[Switzerland]], [[Monaco]] and [[Liechtenstein]].

'''BBC Two''' is a [[Television in the United Kingdom|British]] [[free-to-air]] television network owned and operated by the [[BBC]]. It covers a wide range of subject matter, with a remit "to broadcast [[highbrow|programmes of depth and substance]]" in contrast to the more mainstream and popular [[BBC One]].

Like the BBC's other domestic TV and radio channels, it is funded by the [[television licence]], and is therefore free of commercial advertising. It is a comparatively well-funded [[Public broadcasting|public-service]] network, regularly attaining a much higher audience share than most public-service networks worldwide.

Originally styled '''BBC2''', it was the third British television station to be launched (starting on 21 April 1964), and from 1 July 1967, Europe's first television channel to broadcast regularly in colour. It was envisaged as a home for less mainstream and more ambitious programming, and while this tendency has continued to date, most special-interest programmes of a kind previously broadcast on BBC Two, for example the [[The Proms|BBC Proms]], now tend to appear on [[BBC Four]] instead.

==History==
{{further|Timeline of BBC Two}}

===Launch===
[[File:BBC Two (box variant).svg|thumbnail|left|Boxed variant of 2007 to 2021 logo, used from 2007 to 2018 as a primary logo and from 2018 to 2021 as a secondary one.]]

British television at the time of BBC2's launch consisted of two channels: the [[BBC One|BBC Television Service]] and the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] network made up of smaller regional companies. Both channels had existed in a state of competition since ITV's launch in 1955, and both had aimed for a populist approach in response. The 1962 [[Pilkington Committee on Broadcasting|Pilkington Report]] on the future of broadcasting noticed this, and that ITV lacked any culturally relevant programming. It therefore decided that Britain's third television station should be awarded to the BBC.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sixtiescity.com/Television/BritishTV.htm |title=British Television up to the end of the Sixties |publisher=Sixtiescity.com |access-date=12 September 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071024020910/http://www.sixtiescity.com/Television/BritishTV.htm |archive-date=24 October 2007 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

Prior to its launch, the new BBC2 was promoted on the BBC Television Service: the soon-to-be-renamed [[BBC1]]. The animated adverts featured the campaign mascots "Hullabaloo", a mother [[kangaroo]], and "Custard", her [[Joey (marsupial)|joey]]. Prior to, and several years after, the channel's formal launch, the channel broadcast "[[Trade test colour films|Trade Test Transmissions]]", short films made externally by companies such as [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]] and [[BP]], which served to enable engineers to test reception, but became [[Cult following|cult]] viewing.

The channel was scheduled to begin at 19:20 on 20 April 1964, showing an evening of light entertainment, starting with the comedy show ''[[The Alberts]]'', a performance from [[Soviet]] comedian [[Arkady Raikin]], and a production of [[Cole Porter]]'s ''[[Kiss Me, Kate]]'', culminating with a fireworks display. However, at around 18:45 a huge power failure, originating from a fire at [[Battersea Power Station]], caused [[BBC Television Centre|Television Centre]], and indeed much of west London, to lose all power. BBC1 was able to continue broadcasting via its facilities at [[Alexandra Palace]], but all attempts to show the scheduled programmes on the new channel failed. [[Associated-Rediffusion]], the London weekday ITV franchise-holder, offered to transmit on the BBC's behalf, but their gesture was rejected. At 22:00 programming was officially postponed until the following morning. As the BBC's news centre at [[Alexandra Palace]] was unaffected, they did in fact broadcast brief bulletins on BBC2 that evening, beginning with an announcement by the newsreader [[Gerald Priestland]] at around 19:25.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Williams |first1=Hywel |url=https://www.hywel.org.uk/bbc2launch/ |title=BBC 2 Aborted Launch Night |access-date=12 September 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210614045852/https://www.hywel.org.uk/bbc2launch/ |archive-date=14 June 2021 |url-status=live }}</ref> There was believed to be no recording made of this bulletin, but a videotape was discovered in early 2003.<ref name="BBC2 Launch BBC news">{{cite news |last=Briggs |first=Caroline |title=The launch night that never was |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/3585041.stm |access-date=4 October 2011 |work=[[BBC News]] |date=20 April 2004}}</ref>

By 11:00 on 21 April, power had been restored to the [[BBC Television Centre|studios]] and programming began, thus making ''[[Play School (UK TV series)|Play School]]'' the first programme to be shown officially on the channel. The launch schedule, postponed from the night before, was then successfully shown that evening, albeit with minor changes. In reference to the power cut, the transmission opened with a shot of a lit candle which was then sarcastically blown out by presenter [[Denis Tuohy]].<ref name="BBC2 Launch BBC news"/>

To establish the new channel's identity and draw viewers to it, the BBC decided that a widely promoted, lavish series would be essential in its earliest days. The production chosen was ''[[The Forsyte Saga (1967 series)|The Forsyte Saga]]'' (1967), a no-expense-spared adaptation of the novels by [[John Galsworthy]], featuring well-established actors [[Kenneth More]] and [[Eric Porter]]. Critically for the future of the fledgling channel, the BBC's gamble was hugely successful, with an average of six million viewers tuning in per episode: a feat made more prominent by the fact that only 9 million were able to receive the channel at the time.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

===Technological advancements===
Unlike [[BBC1]] and [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]], BBC2 was broadcast only on the [[576i|625 line]] [[Ultra high frequency|UHF]] system, so was not available to viewers still using sets only capable of receiving the [[405-line television system|405-line]] [[Very high frequency|VHF]] system. This created a market for dual standard receivers which could switch between the two systems. Set manufacturers increased production of UHF sets in anticipation of a large market demand for the new BBC2, but the market did not materialise. The early technical problems, which included being unable to transmit US-recorded videotapes due to a lack of [[Television standards conversion|system conversion]] from the US [[NTSC]] system, were resolved by a committee headed by [[James Redmond (broadcaster)|James Redmond]].

On 1 July 1967, during the [[1967 Wimbledon Championships|Wimbledon Championships]], BBC2 became the first channel in Europe to begin regular broadcasts in colour, using the [[PAL]] system.<ref>[http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/technology/technology8.html TV Technology 8. Britain In Colour – and UHF.] Screenonline, Richard G. Elen. Retrieved 26 November 2010.</ref> The thirteen-part series ''[[Civilisation: A Personal View|Civilisation]]'' (1969) was created as a celebration of two millennia of western art and culture to showpiece the new colour technology.<ref>[[David Attenborough]] extra on BBC DVD ''[[Civilisation (TV series)|Civilisation]]'' by [[Kenneth Clark]].</ref> BBC1 and ITV later joined BBC2 on 625-line UHF band but continued to simulcast on 405-line VHF until 1985. BBC1 and ITV simultaneously introduced PAL colour on UHF on 15 November 1969, although they both had broadcast some programmes in colour "unofficially" since September 1969.

In 1979, the station adopted the first computer-generated channel identification (ident) in Britain, with its use of the [[BBC Two 'Computer Generated 2' ident|double striped, orange '2' logo]]. The ident, created in-house by BBC engineers, lasted until March 1986 and heralded the start of computer-generated logos.

As the [[Digital terrestrial television in the United Kingdom#Digital switchover|switch to digital-only terrestrial transmission]] progressed, BBC Two was (in each region in turn) the first [[Analogue terrestrial television in the United Kingdom|analogue TV channel]] to be replaced with the BBC multiplex, at first four, then two weeks ahead of the other four channels. This was required for those relay transmitters that had no current [[Freeview (UK)|Freeview]] service giving viewers time to purchase the equipment unless they had already selected a satellite or cable service. The last region for BBC Two to end on analogue terrestrial television was [[Northern Ireland]] on 10 October 2012.

At the 2012 [[Edinburgh International Television Festival]], BBC Two was named "Terrestrial Channel of the Year".<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-19376264  "BBC Two wins terrestrial channel of the year". BBC News, 24 August 2012]. Retrieved 28 June 2013.</ref>

A [[high-definition television|high-definition]] simulcast of BBC Two began broadcasting on 26 March 2013, replacing the standalone [[BBC HD]] channel.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.whathifi.com/news/bbc-two-hd-channel-to-launch-on-march-26 |work=What Hi-Fi |title=BBC Two HD channel goes live, replacing BBC HD |access-date=9 July 2013 |date=26 March 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130615062146/http://www.whathifi.com/news/bbc-two-hd-channel-to-launch-on-march-26 |archive-date=15 June 2013 |url-status=dead}}</ref> {{As of|2018|11|29}}, there are three variations of BBC Two HD (Wales, Northern Ireland, and England).<ref>{{cite web |title=Changes to our HD portfolio and satellite transponders |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/aboutthebbc/entries/7a69712a-5942-4792-af89-99f73c731bbd |work=About the BBC Blog |access-date=29 November 2018 |date=16 October 2018}}</ref>

* 2017–present: [[Patrick Holland (television executive)|Patrick Holland]]

Adam Barker served as Acting Controller of the channel after Janice Hadlow left the channel in March 2014 and until Kim Shillinglaw began as the new permanent occupant of the post.

From 2013, the Controller of BBC Two was given the expanded title Controller of BBC Two and [[BBC Four]], with ultimate oversight of the BBC Four service added to their duties (a BBC Four "Channel Editor", reporting up to this Controller, was allocated day-to-day operational control of Four).

The channel forms part of the [[BBC Television]] executive group and is answerable to the head of that department, and to the [[BBC Trust]].

On 20 January 2016, Kim Shillinglaw announced that she had decided to leave the BBC as the Controller of BBC Two & BBC Four;, as a result of the reorganisation, the posts of Controller of BBC Two and BBC Four were closed.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2016/controller-tv-and-iplayer |title=Strategic reorganisation of BBC TV sees Charlotte Moore appointed Controller, TV Channels and iPlayer |access-date=12 November 2018}}</ref>

==Programming==
{{main|List of television programmes broadcast by the BBC}}
{{quotation|BBC Two's remit is to be a mixed-genre channel appealing to a broad adult audience with programmes of depth and substance. It should carry the greatest amount and range of [[knowledge building]] programming of any BBC television channel, complemented by distinctive comedy, drama and arts programming.|'''BBC Two remit'''<ref name="BBC Two Remit 2011">{{cite web |title=BBC Two Service License |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/bbctrust/assets/files/pdf/regulatory_framework/service_licences/tv/2011/bbc_two_feb11.pdf |publisher=BBC Trust |access-date=4 October 2011}}</ref>}}

BBC Two's historical scope was arts, culture, some comedy and drama, and appealing to audiences not already served by BBC One or ITV. Over its first thirty or so years the channel developed a reputation for screening highly praised and prestigious drama series, among these ''[[Boys from the Blackstuff]]'' (1982), 1991's highly successful ''[[The Men's Room]]'', a spectacular costume drama ''[[Middlemarch (TV serial)|Middlemarch]]'' (1994) or 1996's critically acclaimed ''[[Our Friends in the North]]''. The channel's "highbrow" profile is also in part attributable to a long history of demanding documentaries of all types, beginning with ''[[Civilisation: A Personal View|Civilisation]]'' and ''[[The Ascent of Man]]'' in the 1960s. Like the early [[Channel 4]], BBC Two also established for itself a reputation as a champion of independent and international cinema, under the ''Screen 2'' brand.

The channel has sometimes been judged, increasingly in more recent years, to have moved away from this original role and closer to the mainstream. Since the launch of the digital-only [[BBC Four]], the BBC has been accused in particular of shifting its more highbrow output to the new channel, which, until the end of the UK's digital TV switchover in October 2012,<ref>[http://www.digitaluk.co.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0004/82057/24-10-12_DSO_completion.pdf ''End of analogue era as switchover completes'', Digital UK, London, 10 October 2012].

BBC Four's remit is very similar to the earlier remit of BBC2, and contains many documentaries and arts programmes. It has been perceived by some that this strategy is to allow BBC Two to show more popular programmes and to secure higher ratings.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/organgrinder/2007/09/bbc_funding_debate_why_bbc2_bb.html |title=Blogposts |work=The Guardian}}</ref> Since 2004 there have been some signs of an attempt to return closer to parts of BBC Two's earlier output with the arts strand ''[[The Culture Show]]''. Its most popular programme at the moment is ''[[Top Gear (2002 TV series)|Top Gear]]'', which now moved to BBC One.

Much of BBC Two's output has previously or subsequently been shown on other channels. Some of these programmes are repeats of popular or flagship programmes from BBC Four in a late-night strand, originally called ''BBC Four on Two'' but now unbranded. Other programmes are moved to the channel as a result of their success on [[BBC Three (former)|BBC Three]] or Four, so that subsequent series are well received. An example of this is the BBC Three series ''[[Torchwood]]'', which was transferred to the channel following the success of the first series. BBC Two is also used as a testing ground for programmes prior to their moving to the flagship [[BBC One]]: such examples include ''[[Have I Got News for You]]'' and popular comedies ''[[Absolutely Fabulous]]'' and ''[[Miranda (TV series)|Miranda]]'', which moved to BBC One after success on Two. Also in August 2014, ''[[The Great British Bake Off]]'' moved to BBC One, due to its success the previous year on BBC Two. In 2017, ''Bake Off'' moved from BBC One to [[Channel 4]].

Another founding part of BBC Two was to provide educational and community programming on the BBC, as part of its public service remit. The educational section of this commitment saw BBC2 broadcast a large amount of programming for the [[Open University]], who co-produced programming with the corporation, and saw the channel broadcast [[BBC Schools]] programmes from 1983 until the programmes were transferred to the [[BBC Learning Zone]] in 2010.

As a result of the channel's commitment to community broadcasting, the channel produced the symbolic ''[[Open Space (BBC TV)|Open Space]]'' series, a strand developed in the early 1970s in which members of the public would be allotted half an hour of television time, and given a level of editorial and technical training in order to produce for themselves a film on an issue most important to them. BBC2's [[Community Programme Unit]] kept this aspect of the channel's tradition alive into the 1990s in the form of ''Video Diaries'' and later ''[[Video Nation]]''. The Community Programmes Unit was disbanded in 2004.

In January 2013, BBC Two ceased to show children's programmes and replaced the weekday morning schedule with repeats of the previous BBC One daytime schedule. It also began showing ''Sign Zone'' in the early hours; prior to 2013, this had been broadcast by BBC One.

From October 2013, BBC Two has shown classic programmes like ''[[Bergerac (TV series)|Bergerac]]'', ''[[Cagney and Lacey]]'', ''[[The Rockford Files]]'', ''[['Allo 'Allo!]]'', and ''[[Are You Being Served?]]'' on weekday afternoons, with the retro logos from 1970s and 1980s, between the current programmes.{{cn|date=November 2021}}

In October 2014, ''[[Russell Howard's Good News]]'' and ''[[Backchat (2013 TV series)|Backchat]]'' moved to BBC Two from BBC Three.

In 2014, BBC Two commissioned Britain's first transgender sitcom, ''[[Boy Meets Girl (BBC TV series)|Boy Meets Girl]]'', which follows the developing relationship between Leo, a 26-year-old man, and Judy, a 40-year-old transgender woman.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/bbc2-commissions-britains-first-transgender-sitcom-boy-meets-girl-9683788.html |title=BBC2 commissions Britain's first transgender sitcom Boy Meets Girl |work=[[The Independent]]|date=22 August 2014 }}</ref>

From 7 April 2015, the morning ''Sign Zone'' was shown before ''[[Victoria Derbyshire (TV programme)|Victoria Derbyshire]]'' between 8:00am-9:00&nbsp;am including ''See Hear'' on Wednesday morning.

BBC Two is also known for broadcasting some news and [[Current affairs (news format)|current affairs]] programmes. It broadcasts BBC News updates every morning at 9 am, simulcasting [[BBC News (TV channel)|the BBC News channel]] after it stops simulcasting ''[[BBC Breakfast]]'' on BBC1. At 12:15 pm during the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament session]], [[policy debate|political debate]] programme ''[[Politics Live]]'' is broadcast on BBC Two. On Wednesdays, due to the [[Prime Minister's Questions]], the programme is broadcast at the earlier time of 11:15am. The programme is not broadcast on Fridays or when Parliament is on a holiday break, so the simulcast of BBC News continues until 1:00pm for the ''[[BBC News at One]]'' on BBC One. At 10:30pm, current affairs programme ''[[Newsnight]]'' provides reports and analysis of the stories behind the day's headlines. BBC Two does not broadcast any news and current affairs programming at the weekend.

From 2017 until 2019, it broadcast the UK selection show for the [[Eurovision Song Contest]], [[United Kingdom in the Eurovision Song Contest|''Eurovision: You Decide'']]. The channel stopped broadcasting the show after the 2019 edition due to the fact that the BBC opted for an internal selection in collaboration with [[BMG Rights Management]].

In 2020, it was reported that the programme ''Victoria Derbyshire'' would end, owing to the BBC's £80m cuts.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-51214425 |title=Derbyshire tells viewers 'we don't give up' |date=23 January 2020 |work=BBC News |access-date=16 April 2020}}</ref> Since the beginning of the [[COVID-19 pandemic]], [[Victoria Derbyshire]] has been presenting the first hour of BBC News, which continues until 13:00.{{cn|date=November 2021}}

BBC Two is also known for broadcasting some BBC One programmes in a change to the schedules when that channel is broadcasting a BBC News Special. For example; during the COVID-19 pandemic, BBC1 aired [[press conferences]] from the [[Government of the United Kingdom|UK government]] about major developments from the pandemic and the scheduled BBC One programming during those News Specials was broadcast on BBC Two. However on 9 April 2021 – the day of the [[death and funeral of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|death]] of [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]] – BBC Two and BBC One both simulcast BBC News for the whole day.

{{main|History of BBC television idents|l1=History of BBC television idents}}
[[File:BBC Two Paint ident.jpg|thumb|The sans-serif 2 served as the channel's design icon between 1991 and 2018, and was used in several different forms. "Paint", pictured above, was the first such variant to air, and aired between 1991 and 2001 and again between 2014 and 2018.]]
As well as programmes, BBC Two has also proved memorable for its numerous [[Station identification|idents]]—various short sequences shown between programme junctions that serve as the channel identity. Nearly all of the identity packages used since the channel's launch in 1964 have featured a prominent numeral ''2'' in the design. Notable designs include the electronic [[BBC Two 'Computer Generated 2' ident|double-striped ''2'']], the [[BBC Two 'Two' ident|white ''TWO'']] ident (the only ident not to use a numeral ''2''), and most notably the [[BBC Two '1991–2001' idents|1991 ''2''s]].

The 1991 idents featured a [[sans-serif]] numeral ''2'' at the centre of an initially art-related scene; however, the idents moved away from this style as the station's style changed. Although highly praised, this expansive set of idents was ended in November 2001. The [[Logo of the BBC|BBC corporate logo]] was updated within the idents in October 1997, though the idents moved away from the original [[viridian]] colour scheme in these latter years. The [[BBC Two 'Personality' idents|subsequent presentation style]] was introduced on 19 November 2001 and kept the same figure ''2'', but in a yellow background and given a personality. At the time, BBC Two became the first BBC channel to feature a box logo.

In 2007, BBC Two debuted [[BBC Two 'Window on the World' idents|the new theme]], a "Window on the World", with the ''2'' numeral providing that view. Introduced on 18 February 2007, the new look also had the channel adopt a teal-coloured box logo, featuring the BBC logo above the word ''TWO'', in the font [[Avenir (typeface)|Avenir]].

In 2014, in honour of the channel's 50th anniversary, some of the 1990s idents were re-introduced and from 2015, BBC Two [[Northern Ireland]] opted to use nearly forty idents from the 1991–2001 set.

On 27 September 2018, the 1991–2001 idents were retired once again and BBC Two introduced a new set of idents, based on scenes incorporating a curve motif resembling the number 2. The new branding is designed to reflect BBC Two's "constant evolution, constant eclecticism, [and] constant sense of quality". The new idents are produced by various artists and studios, including [[Aardman Animations]], [[The Mill (company)|The Mill]] and others. The new identity was co-developed by BBC Creative and Superunion.<ref>{{cite news|last=Waterson |first=Jim |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/sep/25/bbc-two-first-full-rebrand-25-years |title=BBC Two to get first full rebrand since early 90s |newspaper=The Guardian |date=25 September 2018 |access-date=26 September 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thedrum.com/news/2018/09/26/bbc-two-issues-re-invigorating-rebrand-vivid-and-colourful-reflect-content-diversity|title=BBC Two issues 're-invigorating' rebrand, vivid and colourful to reflect content diversity|work=The Drum|access-date=27 September 2018|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Dawood |first1=Sarah |title=BBC Two rebrands for first time in 20 years |url=https://www.designweek.co.uk/issues/24-30-september-2018/bbc-two-rebrands-for-first-time-in-20-years/ |access-date=29 September 2018 |work=Design Week |publisher=Centaur Communications |date=26 September 2018}}</ref>

===Regional variations===
BBC Two also has regional variations in [[BBC Two Wales|Wales]] and [[BBC Two Northern Ireland|Northern Ireland]]. These versions of BBC Two share the same idents, but with the nation name in the BBC Two box. BBC Two Scotland showed a lot of specifically Scottish programming on the channel, as well as its sister channel [[BBC One Scotland]], and the schedules were often mixed around to match. BBC Two Northern Ireland and BBC Two Wales both have the option to opt-out of the main network schedule but generally stick to it, only opting out a couple of times each week. Until December 2008, [[BBC Cymru Wales|BBC Wales]] broadcast a special, digital-only channel, [[BBC 2W]], which contained more opt-outs than analogue-only BBC Two Wales. [[BBC Two Scotland]] existed until February 2019 when it was replaced with the national BBC Two feed in preparation for the launch of the [[BBC Scotland (TV channel)|BBC Scotland channel]].

In England, many of the [[BBC English regions]] were combined to form "super-regions", such as the entire North or Midlands. These had the option to opt-out of the network programming on the analogue feed, and replace it with local programming. However this was usually only done in exceptional circumstances, as all regular regional programming has been transferred to BBC One, and the English regions are not available on digital on BBC Two. There is no specific "BBC Two England"; this role is fulfilled by the network version of BBC Two.

==Availability outside the UK==
The [[BBC Two Northern Ireland|Northern Irish]] version of BBC Two is widely available in the [[Republic of Ireland]] on satellite and [[Cable television in the Republic of Ireland|cable]], as well as being received directly in areas bordering [[Northern Ireland]], or in coastal areas from [[Wales]]. The networked version of BBC Two is also available on cable and [[IPTV]] in the [[Netherlands]], Belgium, [[Switzerland]], [[Monaco]] and [[Liechtenstein]]. 
The channel is registered to broadcast within the European Union/EEA through the Luxembourgish Broadcasting Regulator - ALIA.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.alia.lu/en/television/supervisory-activities|title = Supervisory activities|date = 13 November 2021}}</ref><ref>https://www.alia.lu/assets/upload/files/2021-03-17Liste-des-services-de-television-maj-mars-2021_site-ALIA.pdf</ref>

==BBC Two HD==
[[File:BBC Two HD flat.svg|thumb]]
Originally, programmes from BBC Two were shown in [[High-definition television|high definition]] on the dedicated [[BBC HD]] channel, alongside programmes from [[BBC Three (former)|BBC Three]] and [[BBC Four]], as well as some select series from [[CBBC (TV channel)|CBBC]] and [[CBeebies]]. However, in plans outlined by the director general [[Mark Thompson (television executive)|Mark Thompson]] on 6 October 2011, BBC HD would close to be replaced by ''BBC Two HD'', a high-definition simulcast of BBC Two that would work much the same way as [[BBC One#BBC One HD|BBC One HD]].<ref>{{cite news |title=BBC set to cut 2,000 jobs by 2017 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-15165926 |access-date=7 October 2011 |work=BBC News |date=6 October 2011}}</ref> This move allowed the corporation to save £2.1&nbsp;million, used to count towards its budget deficit following the freezing of the licence fee and the additional financial responsibility of addition services.<ref>{{cite news |title=BBC cuts at a glance |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-15186116 |access-date=7 October 2011 |work=BBC News |date=6 October 2011}}</ref>

On 16 July 2013, the BBC indicated that it wants to launch Northern Irish, Scottish and Welsh variations of BBC Two HD; however, this would require the approval of the BBC Trust, with a proposal due to be presented within six months.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2013/BBCHDChannels.html |title=BBC to launch five new subscription-free HD channels |publisher=BBC Media Centre |date=17 July 2013 |access-date=17 July 2013 |archive-date=26 July 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180726121230/https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2013/bbchdchannels.html |url-status=dead }}</ref>

In October 2018, the BBC announced that regional variants of BBC Two HD in [[Wales]] and [[Northern Ireland]] would launch at the end of November that year on terrestrial, satellite (Wales only) and iPlayer. BBC Two HD in these regions were swapped with the SD channel on Sky's EPG for HD subscribers. Due to the impending launch of the new BBC Scotland channel in February 2019, replacing the opt-outs on [[BBC Two Scotland]], no Scottish HD variant was required.

==History==
BBC Four launched on 2 March 2002 at 7:00&nbsp;pm [[Greenwich Mean Time|GMT]], having been delayed from the original planned 2001 launch. BBC Four began originally as a late schedule to BBC Two, before it received its own channel, along with [[BBC Three]]. Curiously, BBC Four had to launch before BBC Three as a result of the government delaying approval plans. The channel replaced [[BBC Knowledge]], an educational and cultural channel which had undergone many changes throughout its lifetime; in its final format it carried a schedule of documentaries and art programming, essentially a test of the new BBC Four schedule. BBC Four would rebrand this channel, and bring it into line with the well recognised BBC One and Two brands at the same time. Planning for the new channel, along with the new [[BBC Three]], had been in progress since October 2000; however, the incumbent government delayed approving the new BBC digital plans. The BBC Four plans were approved earlier, and as a result launched before BBC Three.

BBC Four was different from the old BBC Knowledge: the channel would be more heavily promoted with more new and original programming and the channel would not be broadcast 24 hours a day. This was because on the [[Freeview (UK)|Freeview]] [[digital terrestrial television|digital terrestrial]] platform, BBC Four is broadcast in a [[statistical time division multiplexing|statistically multiplexed]] stream in Multiplex B that timeshares with the [[CBeebies]] channel (which is on air from 06:00 until 19:00). As a result, BBC Four broadcasts from 19:00 to around 03:35 each night, with an hour's down-time and promotions for CBeebies before the start of that channel's schedule.

On 12 May 2011, BBC Four was added to the Sky [[Electronic program guide|EPG]] in the Republic of Ireland on channel 230. It later moved to EPG 211 to free up space for new channels.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theairwaves.net/channelnews/4399-ireland-extra-bbc-channels-being-added-to-sky-epg |title=Ireland: Extra BBC channels being added to Sky EPG |publisher=The Airwaves |date=2 May 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110507070203/http://www.theairwaves.net/channelnews/4399-ireland-extra-bbc-channels-being-added-to-sky-epg |archive-date=7 May 2011 }}</ref> It later moved to channel 143 on 1 May 2018 to sit beside the [[BBC Northern Ireland|Northern Irish]] versions of [[BBC One]] and [[BBC Two]] there, and the 200s being used for +1 channels.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.a516digital.com/2018/05/sky-completes-biggest-channel-reshuffle.html |title=Sky completes biggest channel reshuffle – a516digital |publisher=a516digital |date=1 May 2018}}</ref>

On 17 August 2018, BBC Four announced BBC 4.1, a special two nights of programming which would revolve around [[artificial intelligence]] (AI) selecting the programmes broadcast on the channel, based on "what BBC Four audiences might like, based on the channel's previous schedules and programme attributes." It would then "[rank] programmes it thought were most relevant [to what BBC Four viewers would like]."<ref name="BBCMediaCentre">{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2018/bbc-four-ai|title=BBC Four announces experimental AI and archive programming|date=17 August 2018|website=BBC Media Centre|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200221125701/https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2018/bbc-four-ai|archive-date=21 February 2020|access-date=23 April 2020}}</ref> The programming was aired on the nights of 4 and 5 September 2018.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://inews.co.uk/news/ai-to-create-channel-schedule-and-new-programmes-in-bbc-technology-trial-508623|title=AI to create BBC channel schedule and new programmes in technology trial|last=Sherwin|first=Adam|date=17 August 2018|website=i News|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200423105339/https://inews.co.uk/news/ai-to-create-channel-schedule-and-new-programmes-in-bbc-technology-trial-508623|archive-date=23 April 2020|access-date=23 April 2020}}</ref> This included a few special programmes about AI,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p06jt9ng|title=AI TV on BBC 4.1|website=BBC|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200423104927/https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p06jt9ng|archive-date=23 April 2020|access-date=23 April 2020}}</ref> such as "Made by Machine: When AI Met The Archive", which documented how the AI works,<ref name="BBCMediaCentre" /> and "The Joy of AI", where "the emergence of machine learning" is discussed, as well as "why [AI] shouldn't spook us".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/tech/bbc-4-turns-to-ai-to-create-two-nights-of-programming-about-ai/5131773.article|title=BBC 4 turns to AI to create two nights of programming about AI|last=Bickerton|first=Jake|date=20 August 2018|website=Broadcast|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190709132807/https://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/tech/bbc-4-turns-to-ai-to-create-two-nights-of-programming-about-ai/5131773.article|archive-date=9 July 2019|access-date=23 April 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0bhwhw1|title=BBC Four {{en dash}} The Joy of AI|website=BBC|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191026222356/https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0bhwhw1|archive-date=26 October 2019|access-date=23 April 2020}}</ref>

Due to the launch of [[BBC Scotland (TV channel)|BBC Scotland]] on 24 February 2019, BBC Four has been on a lower [[Freeview (UK)|Freeview]] EPG number in Scotland than elsewhere, moving to 82 to make room for BBC Scotland. Following eventual closures, it moved to channel 75 there, and later to channel 68, and eventually channel 55.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Why BBC Four is moving channels AGAIN on Scottish Freeview...|url=https://www.rxtvlog.com/2019/10/why-bbc-four-is-moving-channels-again.html|access-date=2020-05-20}}</ref> On 4 November 2020, due to [[Ofcom]] proposals regarding certain PSB channels requiring greater prominence on each UK TV provider's channel listing, BBC Four moved to channel 24 in Scotland, while every channel from [[ITV4|that number]] (ITV4) to [[5Select|channel 54]] (5SELECT) moved down one place.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Revised rules on the allocation of LCNs to public service channels - Freeview|url=https://www.freeview.co.uk/psb-lcn-rules|access-date=2020-09-02}}</ref>

In May 2020, the BBC submitted its annual general plan for 2020–21, which included a proposal for BBC Two to supplant BBC Four as its main outlet for specialist programmes. Under the plan, BBC Four would cease originating new programmes, and become a service showcasing the BBC's "rich archive". The plan also included the possibility of the BBC expanding BBC Four into a global brand, to "[take] our strengths in specialist factual to the world stage."<ref>{{Cite web|title=Global ambitions for BBC Four; changes for BBC Two|url=https://www.rxtvlog.com/2020/05/global-ambitions-for-bbc-four-changes.html|date=2020-05-20|website=RXTVlog|access-date=2020-05-20}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=BBC Eyes Plan To Make BBC Four A Global Subscription Service|url=https://deadline.com/2020/05/bbc-considers-bbc-four-global-subscription-service-1202939262/|last=Kanter|first=Jake|date=2020-05-20|website=Deadline|language=en|access-date=2020-05-20}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=BBC - Annual Plan - record-breaking performance but challenges ahead - Media Centre|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2020/annual-plan|website=www.bbc.co.uk|access-date=2020-05-20}}</ref>

On 9 April 2021, the day that [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]] died, BBC Four was suspended for a whole day so the BBC could continue coverage of [[Death and funeral of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|the Duke's death]] across its television, radio and online services. The next day (10 April) BBC Four resumed airing at the normal time of 7:00&nbsp;pm.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.stokesentinel.co.uk/news/stoke-on-trent-news/complaints-over-tv-coverage-prince-5284350|title=BBC sets up dedicated complaints page for Prince Philip coverage|first=Phil|last=Corrigan|date=10 April 2021|website=StokeonTrentLive}}</ref>

During the [[Logo of the BBC#2020s|rollout of BBC's new corporate logo]] on 20 October 2021, the logo of BBC Four was also changed. In line with BBC's other domestic services, it is no longer seen in boxed form. Its most notable change, however, is in its colour, which is purple instead of black.

==Organisation==
The channel direction is determined by the channel's remit, set by royal charter and the corporation's governing body (the [[BBC Board]]), and by the channel controller. In October 2013, following the departure of Richard Klein from the controllership, the management of the channel changed, with the role of Controller of BBC Four scrapped: from this point the Controller of BBC Two would have ultimate oversight of BBC Four as part of their role, absorbing some of the former duties of the Controller of BBC Four, but a new 'Channel Editor' post, reporting up to this controller, would be created to take day-to-day charge of Four. The controllers of BBC Four from 2002 to 2016 have been:

Prior to launch, the majority of BBC Four's HD output was broadcast on the [[BBC HD]] channel before its closure on 26 March 2013. In 2017 BBC Four HD along with CBBC HD and Cbeebies HD launched in Ireland.

The first evening's BBC Four programmes were [[simulcast]] on [[BBC Two]],<ref name="bbcpress" /> with the first programme being ''The Man Who Destroyed Everything'', a documentary about conceptual artist [[Michael Landy]] and his installation [[Break Down (Landy artwork)|Break Down]].<ref>{{cite web | title=The Man Who Destroyed Everything | website=BBC Four | date=2021-04-13 | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000s4pw | access-date=2021-04-20}}</ref> BBC Four was also notable for first showing [[Larry David]]'s ''[[Seinfeld]]'' follow-up, ''[[Curb Your Enthusiasm]]'',<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/features/watch-and-learn-bbc-fours-success-is-a-sign-that-britain-is-regaining-a-hunger-for-intelligent-broadcasting-1902807.html |work=The Independent |title=Watch and learn: BBC Four's success is a sign that Britain is regaining a hunger for intelligent broadcasting |access-date=23 February 2010 | date=15 February 2010 | location=London | first=Ian | last=Burrell}}</ref> [[Armando Iannucci]]'s cutting [[political satire]], ''[[The Thick of It]]'', ''[[The Chaser's War on Everything]]'', ''[[Flight of the Conchords (TV series)|Flight of the Conchords]]'', ''[[Mad Men]]'' and [[Denmark|Danish]] thriller ''[[Forbrydelsen|The Killing]]''.

The channel broadcasts a mixture of [[art]] and [[science]] [[Documentary film|documentaries]], vintage [[drama]] (including many rare [[black-and-white]] programmes), and non-English-language productions such as [[film]]s from the [[Artificial Eye]] catalogue, the French thriller ''[[Spiral (TV series)|Spiral]]'' and the Swedish detective series ''[[Wallander (Swedish TV series)|Wallander]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00rwm3r|title=BBC Four – Wallander|work=BBC}}</ref> BBC Four further supports foreign-language films with its annual [[BBC Four World Cinema Awards|World Cinema Award]] which has been running since 2004.

Until the middle of 2020, BBC Four broadcast a global news bulletin on weekdays at 19:00 which most recently was a simulcast of ''Beyond 100 Days'' Monday–Thursday and an edition of ''World News Today'' on Fridays which was produced by [[BBC World News]]. This replaced ''The World'' and ''BBC Four News'' which aired in the slot from the launch of the channel. As of autumn 2020, BBC Four no longer broadcasts a news bulletin.

It screens a number of documentaries such as ''[[The Century of the Self]]'' and ''[[The Trials of Henry Kissinger]]''. The channel is also home to many political travel shows such as ''[[Holidays in the Axis of Evil]]'' which features investigative journalism.

[[BBC television drama|Drama]] has given the channel some of its most popular programmes, with ''[[Alan Clark|The Alan Clark Diaries]]'' (2003) and ''[[Kenneth Williams: Fantabulosa!]]'' (2006) being among the highest rated, with over 800,000 viewers. The highly acclaimed [[Hattie (film)|Hattie]], broadcast in 2011, holds the record for BBC4's best ever consolidated ratings of 2m / 8%.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Chris Curtis on Twitter|url = https://twitter.com/ChrisMCurtis/status/672063975597678593|website = Twitter|access-date = 3 December 2015|publisher = Editor, Broadcast}}</ref> Before that ''[[The Curse of Steptoe]]'' brought the channel its highest audience figures, estimated as 1.41&nbsp;million viewers, a 7% share of multichannel audiences between 21:00 and 22:05, based on overnight returns.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/mar/20/bbc4.ratings "BBC4 breaks ratings record"], ''[[The Guardian]]'' (London), 19 March 2008</ref> The official audience figures for the broadcast, including time-shifting, were later published as 1,625,000.<ref>[[Broadcasters' Audience Research Board|BARB]] multichannel top ten, BBC Four, week ending 23 March 2008</ref> Another notable production was a live re-make of the 1953 science-fiction serial ''[[The Quatermass Experiment (film)|The Quatermass Experiment]]'', adapted from the original scripts into a single, two-hour version (though on the night it, in fact, underran considerably, lasting less than 1 hour 40 minutes), broadcast on the evening of Saturday 2 April 2005. Discounting BBC Four's previous live relays of theatrical [[Shakespeare]] productions, this was the first live made-for-television drama to be broadcast by the BBC for twenty years.

Another notable programme broadcast on BBC Four is ''[[Charlie Brooker's Screenwipe]]'' which contains reviews of current shows, as well as stories and commentary on how television is produced. The show is presented by broadcaster [[Charlie Brooker]].

The channel is also curator and leader of the [[BBC Archives|BBC Archive]] project whose aim is that the BBC's television archive is re-broadcast as much as appropriate so that the Archive can be enjoyed again and not isolated.<ref>Klein, Richard, [https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/aboutthebbc/2012/03/ten-years-of-bbc-four.shtml Ten Years of BBC Four] ''About the BBC Blog'', BBC, Last accessed 3 March 2012</ref>

Some output from BBC Four (documentaries rather than foreign films) was for a time repeated on BBC Two in a 'BBC Four on Two' branded area, although this was often in a late night broadcast slot after ''[[Newsnight]]'' and has since been discontinued.

According to [[BARB]] the comedy panel game ''[[QI]]'' has the highest ratings of any show on BBC Four.<ref>[http://www.qi.com/tv/audience.php Analysis of BARB audience figures], produced for ''[[QI]]'' by the [[BBC]], QI website, accessed 28 March 2008</ref>

At the [[Edinburgh International Television Festival]], BBC Four won the Non-Terrestrial Channel of the Year award in 2004, 2006 and 2012.

In 2012 ''[[Dirk Gently (TV series)|Dirk Gently]]'' became the first continuing drama series produced for the channel.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2011/03_march/31/dirk.shtml |title=Dirk Gently to return to BBC Four |publisher=BBC |date=31 March 2011 |access-date=5 May 2013}}</ref>

Since the initial closure of BBC Three as a linear TV channel, BBC Four is occasionally used to show live sports coverage. The channel aired games from the [[UEFA Euro 2016]] and [[2018 FIFA World Cup]] football tournaments when the final round of matches in the group stages took place (when matches in each group kick-off simultaneously). It has also been used to broadcast England women's football matches, as well as some matches from [[2019 FIFA Women's World Cup]]. It also temporarily extended its broadcast hours to show live action from the [[2016 Summer Olympics]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.a516digital.com/2016/05/bbc-four-to-be-converted-to-sports.html |title= BBC Four to be converted to a sports channel in August |publisher=a516digital |date=26 May 2016 |access-date=24 June 2016}}</ref>

As of 2021, BBC Four schedules still feature music programming (such as ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' and [[Neil Brand]]'s documentaries) on a Friday night,<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/guide/bbcfour/20210205]{{dead link|date=April 2021}}</ref> with drama imports on a Saturday (but not always foreign-language productions like Italian crime drama ''[[Inspector Montalbano (TV series)|Inspector Montalbano]]'')<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b0b60y1x/inspector-montalbano-love|title=Inspector Montalbano - Love|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref><ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/guide/bbcfour/20210206]{{dead link|date=April 2021}}</ref> and usually an hour of 'archive' programmes (such as those by [[Bob Ross]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/m000jy2g/the-joy-of-painting-series-2-5-secluded-forest|title=The Joy of Painting - Series 2: 5.

==Availability outside the UK==
BBC Four is widely available on [[Cable television in the Republic of Ireland|cable]], [[IPTV]] and digital satellite television in the [[Republic of Ireland]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Belgium]], [[Switzerland]], [[Monaco]] and [[Liechtenstein]]. The channel is registered to broadcast within the European Union/EEA through the Luxembourgish Broadcasting Regulator - ALIA.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.alia.lu/en/television/supervisory-activities|title=Supervisory activities|date=20 April 2021|website=www.alia.lu}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.alia.lu/assets/upload/files/2021-03-17Liste-des-services-de-television-maj-mars-2021_site-ALIA.pdf |title=Data |website=www.alia.lu |format=PDF|access-date=2021-04-20}}</ref>

==Presentation==
{{Main|BBC Four idents|History of BBC television idents#BBC Four|l2=History of BBC television idents}}
The channel's initial series of [[Station identification|idents]] were generated [[Audio visualisation|dynamically reflecting the frequencies]] of the continuity announcers' voice or of backing music and were designed by [[Lambie-Nairn]]. As a result, no two idents were ever the same. The first continuity announcer was [[Zeb Soanes]].

When the channel first started airing, it used the slogan "Everybody Needs A Place To Think", but the BBC stopped using this several months after the launch. However the BBC Four logo and above slogan can be found, engraved on benches along the [[South Bank]] in London, between the London Eye and [[Waterloo Bridge]].

On 10 September 2005, the channel began showing new idents comprising a central BBC Four logo surrounded by four quadrants which show different stages of the same footage thus making for a sort of optical illusion; for example, a swimming pool where a person on an inflatable ring appears in the bottom-left corner, though ripples don't enter the remaining quarters. Although the image appears as one at the start of the ident, by the end it is clearly four separate images.

In March 2019, BBC Four added several new idents inspired by "[[oddly satisfying videos]]" in tandem with the quadrants theme, originally premiering for a programme season honouring the 30th anniversary of the [[World Wide Web]].

'''BBC News''' (also known as the '''BBC News Channel''') is a British (TV license needed<ref>{{Cite news|title=BBC News Channel|work=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/av/10473693|access-date=2021-06-15}}</ref>) television news channel. It was launched as '''BBC News 24''' on 9 November 1997 at 5:30&nbsp;pm as part of the BBC's foray into digital domestic television channels, becoming the first competitor to [[Sky News]], which had been running since 1989.<ref name="kcvcng">[https://web.archive.org/web/20040404035846/http://tvhome.co.uk/bbcnews24/about.phtml About BBC News 24] TV Home</ref> For a time, looped news, sport and weather bulletins were available to view via [[BBC Red Button]].

On 22 February 2006, the channel was named ''News Channel of the Year'' at the Royal Television Society Television Journalism Awards for the first time in its history.<ref>[http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/media/news/a29532/bbc-winners-at-tv-journalism-awards.html BBC winners at TV journalism awards] Dave West; Digital Spy, 23 February 2006</ref> The judges remarked that this was the year that the channel had "really come into its own."<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/newswatch/ukfs/hi/newsid_4740000/newsid_4742600/4742620.stm News 24 wins news channel of the year] Newswatch – BBC News Online, 23 February 2006</ref> The channel won the accolade for a second time in 2017.<ref>[https://rts.org.uk/award/rts-programme-awards-2017 RTS Programme Awards 2017] - Royal Television Society</ref>

From May 2007, viewers in the UK could watch the channel via the BBC News website. In April 2008, the channel was renamed ''BBC News'' as part of a £550,000 rebranding of the BBC's news output, complete with a new studio and presentation. Its sister service, BBC World was also renamed ''[[BBC World News]]'' while the national news bulletins became ''BBC News at One'', ''BBC News at Six'' and ''BBC News at Ten''. Across the day the channel averages about twice the audience of Sky News.

The channel is based at and broadcasts from [[Broadcasting House]] in the [[West End of London]].

== History ==
{{Further|Timeline of the BBC News Channel}}

BBC News 24 was originally only available on a full-time basis on cable with all other viewers only able to watch the channel overnight when [[BBC One]] was not on air. This coverage was improved in 1998 with the advent of [[digital television]] in the United Kingdom allowing [[satellite]] and [[digital terrestrial television]] viewers to also view the service. Initially it was difficult to obtain a digital satellite or terrestrial receiver without a subscription to Sky or [[ITV Digital|ONdigital]] respectively, but now the channel forms an important part of the [[Freeview (UK)|Freeview]] and [[Freesat]] channel packages.

The BBC had run the international news channel [[BBC World News|BBC World]] for two and a half years prior to the launch of BBC News 24 on 9 November 1997. [[Sky News]] has had a free hand with domestic news coverage for over eight years (since 5 February 1989) and being owned by [[News Corporation (1980–2013)|News Corporation]] their papers were used to criticise the BBC for extending its news output.<ref>[http://www.chauy.com/2006/07/the-sky-news-blog-%E2%80%93-a-new-angle-in-the-news/ The Sky News Blog-A New Angle In The News?] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207092209/http://www.chauy.com/2006/07/the-sky-news-blog-%E2%80%93-a-new-angle-in-the-news/ |date=7 February 2012 }} Tips 'N' Tutorials</ref>

[[Sky News]] objected to the breaking of its monopoly, complaining about the costs associated with running a channel that only a minority could view from the [[Television licence|licence fee]]. Sky News claimed that a number of British cable operators had been incentivised to carry News 24 (which, as a licence-fee funded channel was made available to such operators for free) in preference to the commercial Sky News. However, in September 1999 the [[European Commission]] ruled against a complaint made by Sky News that the publicly funded channel was unfair and illegal under EU law. The Commission ruled that the [[Television licence|licence fee]] should be considered state aid but that such aid was justified due to the public service remit of the BBC and that it did not exceed actual costs.<ref>[http://www.reckon.co.uk/open/BBC_News_24 BBC News 24 (State aid)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304024952/http://www.reckon.co.uk/open/BBC_News_24 |date=4 March 2016 }} Reckon Regulation & Competition Economics LLP</ref>

The channel's journalistic output has been overseen by Controller of the channel since 16 December 2005. This was a return to having a dedicated Controller for the channel in the same way as the rest of the BBC's domestic television channels. At launch, Tim Orchard was Controller of News 24 from 1997 until 2000. Editorial decisions were then overseen by Rachel Atwell in her capacity as Deputy Head of television news. Her deputy Mark Popescu became responsible for editorial content in 2004, a role he continued in until the appointment of [[Kevin Bakhurst]] as Controller in 2005.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4417472.stm BBC to revamp TV news operation] – BBC News Online, 8 November 2005</ref>

A further announcement by Head of television news [[Peter Horrocks]] came at the same time as Bakhurst's appointment in which he outlined his plan to provide more funding and resources for the channel and shift the corporation's emphasis regarding news away from the traditional BBC One bulletins and across to the rolling news channel. The introduction of simulcasts of the main bulletins on the channel was to allow the news bulletins to pool resources rather than work against each other at key times in the face of competition particularly from Sky News.<ref>{{cite web |title=BBC announces changes to Television News |url=https://tvnewsroom.org/news/bbc-announces-changes-to-television-news-3398/ |website=TV News |access-date=27 July 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080504034036/http://www.tvnewsroom.co.uk/newsdesk/news.php?subaction=showfull&id=1131460853&archive=&start_from=&ucat=5& |archive-date=4 May 2008|date=8 November 2005}}</ref>

On 1 October 2012 Sam Taylor was appointed Controller of BBC News, along with the BBC News at One.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2012/news-channel-controller.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=21 July 2020 |archive-date=21 July 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200721232645/https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2012/news-channel-controller.html |url-status=dead }}</ref>  In 2016 the Controller positions of BBC One and BBC Two were scrapped.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jan/19/bbc-controller-bbc1-charlotte-moore-bbc2-bbc4-kim-shillinglaw|title=BBC scraps BBC1 and BBC2 controller roles after more than 50 years|first=Mark |last=Sweney|author2=Tara Conlan|newspaper=The Guardian|date=19 January 2016}}</ref> Sam Taylor continues as Executive Editor of the BBC News Channel and the BBC News at One.

The [[Board of Governors of the BBC|BBC Governors]]' annual report for 2005/2006 reported that average audience figures for fifteen-minute periods had reached 8.6% in multichannel homes, up from 7.8% in 2004/2005.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/bbctrust/assets/files/pdf/review-report-research/bbcannualreport.pdf BBC Governor's Annual Report 2005/2006] Page 47 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070124022001/http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbctrust/assets/files/pdf/review-report-research/bbcannualreport.pdf |date=24 January 2007 }}</ref> The 2004 report claimed that the channel outperformed Sky News in both weekly and monthly reach in multichannel homes for the January 2004 period, and for the first time in two years moved ahead of Sky News in being perceived as the channel best for news.<ref>[http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/media/news/a15400/bbc-news-24-edging-ahead-of-sky-news.html "BBC News 24 edging ahead of Sky News"], ''Digital Spy'', 19 August 2004.</ref>

=== 2008 rebranding ===
On 21 April 2008, BBC News 24 was renamed ''BBC News'' on the channel itself – but is referred to as the ''BBC News Channel'' on other BBC services.<ref>[http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/media/article3735982.ece BBC News 24 to be renamed] Times Online</ref> This is part of the creative futures plan, launched in 2006, to bring all BBC News output under the single brand name.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/media/2006/jun/12/digitalmedia.marketingandpr Creative Futures Plan] ''The Guardian''</ref>

The BBC News Channel moved from the Studio N8 set, which became home to BBC World News, to what was the home of the national news in Studio N6, allowing the channel to share its set with the ''[[BBC News at One]]'' and the ''[[BBC News at Ten]]'' – with other bulletins moving to Studio TC7.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bbcnewstvchannel.blogspot.in/2015/08/bbc-news-news-24-wins-news-channel-of.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305172908/http://bbcnewstvchannel.blogspot.in/2015/08/bbc-news-news-24-wins-news-channel-of.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=5 March 2016|title=BBC NEWS – News 24 wins news channel of year|date=5 March 2016}}</ref>

=== Move to Broadcasting House ===
The channel relocated, along with the remaining BBC News services at Television Centre, to the newly refurbished Broadcasting House on 18 March 2013 at 13:00 GMT. Presentation and on-screen graphics were refreshed, with new full HD studios and a live newsroom backdrop. Moving cameras in the newsroom form part of the top of the hour title sequence and are used at the start of weather bulletins.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2013/tv_news_move.html|title=BBC News' television output moves to new studios at Broadcasting House|work=BBC|date=18 March 2013|access-date=18 March 2013|archive-date=5 May 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190505071444/https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2013/tv_news_move.html|url-status=dead}}</ref>

On 16 July 2013, the BBC announced that a [[High-definition television|high-definition]] (HD) [[simulcast]] of BBC News would be launched by early 2014.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-23326709 |title=BBC to launch five new HD channels |work=BBC News |date=16 July 2013 |access-date=16 July 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2013/new-hd-channels.html |title=BBC to launch five new subscription-free HD channels on Tuesday 10 December |publisher=BBC |date=9 December 2013 |access-date=9 December 2013 |archive-date=11 December 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131211204948/http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2013/new-hd-channels.html |url-status=dead }}</ref> The channel broadcasts on the BBC's new HD multiplex on Freeview.

[[Image:BBC News (UK) channel, new look 19 March 2013.jpg|thumb|right|[[Sophie Raworth]] presenting the first BBC News at One at Broadcasting House, 18 March 2013, 13:00&nbsp;pm.]]
Each weekday daytime hour consists of headlines on each quarter-hour, extended at the top of the hour to form the main part of the daily schedule.  Overnight, there is generally a bulletin of 25 minutes' length each hour, followed by a weather forecast. A summary airs on the half hour and then there is usually a programme to the weather before the top of the hour. A similar pattern is followed at weekends, with bulletins usually being 30 minutes in length. These patterns will often be displaced by rolling news coverage, including reports and live interviews. This channel also provides the sports news from the BBC Sport centre at MediaCityUK. At 21:25 a global weather forecast is broadcast and at 21:55 ''Weather for the Week Ahead'' is broadcast.

==== Breaking news ====
The BBC maintains guidelines for procedures to be taken for [[breaking news]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/bbctrust/assets/files/pdf/review_report_research/impartiality_business/f2_news_submission.txt |title=Editorial processes – How BBC News works |publisher=[[BBC Trust]] |date=22 January 2007 |access-date=19 June 2007 |url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071019044637/http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbctrust/assets/files/pdf/review_report_research/impartiality_business/f2_news_submission.txt |archive-date=19 October 2007 }}</ref> With domestic news, the correspondent first recorded a "generic minute" summary (for use by all stations and channels) and then priority was to report on [[BBC Radio 5 Live]], then on the BBC News channel and any other programmes that are on air.  Since 5 Live's move to Manchester, this has been reversed.  For foreign news, first a "generic minute" is recorded, then reports are to [[BBC World Service|World Service]] radio, then the reporter talks to any other programmes that are on air.

A key claim made by Lord Lambert in his report had been that the channel was slower to react to breaking news compared with its main rival Sky News.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20040404035846/http://tvhome.co.uk/bbcnews24/about.phtml Getting creative breakthrough...-About BBC News] TV Home</ref> To counteract this, a new feature introduced with the 2003 relaunch was a "breaking news sting": a globe shown briefly onscreen to direct a viewer's attention to the breaking news.

The graphics relaunch in January 2007 saw the globe sting replaced by a red strapline to highlight the breaking story immediately.

To complement this, a permanent live news ticker had earlier been introduced in 2006: this had previously been in use only sporadically. News statements are shown as continuously scrolling upper-case text located at the bottom of the screen; some past ambiguities noted have included spelling the plural of MPs as "MPS", together with other occasional spelling and grammatical errors. The design of this ticker was slightly altered with the 2007 graphics redesign and from June turned red to indicate breaking news, as ''[[Newswatch (BBC)|Newswatch]]'' reported viewers' confusion. The ticker was removed during trails and weather forecasts.

A new set of graphics, including a change to font style, was officially launched in July 2019 although it was broadcast in error up to a couple of months before.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tvforum.uk/thenewsroom/reith-launch-bbc-bulletins-44687|title=BBC News (UK) presentation - Reith launch onwards|website=TV Forum|date=12 July 2019}}</ref>  The news ticker, which had been a long-running feature of the Channel, was replaced by a flipper as stories no longer scroll across the screen. The headlines now have a limited length and appear in full in turn. The word "BREAKING" may appear on screen and flash to indicate breaking news. Occasionally a breaking news sting may appear on the Channel to call attention to breaking news. This sting gained some notoriety in June 2017 when a technical error caused it to appear several times in a row, delaying the start of the BBC News at Ten.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-40350006|title = BBC News at Ten stops for four minutes over technical fault|work = BBC News|date = 21 June 2017}}</ref> Usually the BBC News Channel crosses over to live events, such as press conferences, without using the sting and the presenter on air introduces what viewers are seeing.

==== Overnight and BBC World News simulcasts ====
The BBC began [[simulcast]]ing the channel overnight on [[Terrestrial television|terrestrial]] channel BBC One with the launch of the channel, ending the tradition of a closedown but at the same time effectively making the service available to many more viewers. In the early 2000s, BBC Two also started simulcasting the channel, although the weekend morning show ''Weekend 24'' had been simulcast on the channel in the early days. During major breaking news events, the BBC News Channel has been broadcast on BBC One; examples of special broadcasts include the [[September 11 attacks|11 September 2001 attacks]], [[7 July 2005 London bombings]], [[Operation Red Dawn|the capture of Saddam Hussein]], and the [[death of Osama bin Laden]].<ref>[http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/media/news/a23123/news-24-claims-july-victory.html News 24 claims July victory] Neil Wilkes; Digital Spy, 1 August 2005</ref><ref>[http://www.tvnewsroom.co.uk/newsdesk/news.php?subaction=showfull&id=1124647138&archive=&start_from=&ucat=5& News 24 top for rolling news] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926232800/http://www.tvnewsroom.co.uk/newsdesk/news.php?subaction=showfull&id=1124647138&archive=&start_from=&ucat=5& |date=26 September 2007 }} TV Newsroom, 21 August 2005</ref> In 2020, shared programming between [[BBC One]] and the News Channel has often included the UK Government's [[COVID-19|Coronavirus]] Daily Update. This has been broadcast usually during late afternoons when the Government has made announcements.

Coverage of major events has also been simulcast on BBC World News. Currently, overnight viewers receive 25-minute editions of BBC News every hour, and on weekdays 00:00–02:00 receive ''[[Newsday (programme)|Newsday]]'', live from Singapore and from London which also includes Asia Business Report and Sport Today between 00:30 and 01:00 and also between 01:30 and 02:00
From 02:00–05:00 (00:00–06:00 on weekends) receive ''[[BBC World News (programme)|BBC World News]]''. ''The Briefing'' airs between 05:00–06:00 on weekdays.

These simulcasts have been changed and expanded as a result of the [[COVID-19 pandemic]]. The BBC has introduced a streamlined schedule and the News Channel and BBC World News now share major parts of evening and weekend coverage.  From August this was changed and made permanent to 10:00 to 12:00 and on weekdays 19:00 to 06:00, with opt-outs for [[BBC News at Ten]] and half an hour at 20:30, weekends 21:00 to 06:00, apart from the evening [[BBC One]] bulletin.<ref name="bbc.co.uk">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2020/news-modernisation-update|title=BC News sets out update on modernisation plans|website=Media Centre|publisher=BBC|date=15 July 2020}}</ref>

==== BBC One, BBC Two and BBC World News simulcasts ====
''[[BBC Breakfast]]'' has been simulcast since launch (in 2000) on [[BBC One]] and BBC News, replacing the individual breakfast shows that had run on both channels. Since May 2006 until 17 March 2020, the simulcast generally ran from 06:00 until 08:30 during the week. ''Breakfast'' on BBC One continued from [[MediaCityUK]] until 09:15 with entertainment and features, whilst [[BBC News]] usually went to [[BBC Business Live]] until 09:00 and reverted to its traditional format from 09:00. Since 18 March 2020, the [[COVID-19 pandemic]] has caused changes to these arrangements. Business Live, which had become Worklife, is no longer on air. Weekdays, Breakfast now runs until 09:00 on both BBC One and the BBC News Channel and there is then an hour of news, now called the [[BBC News at Nine]], on both channels. This continues as the first half of two hours of programming on the BBC News Channel, the second hour usually taken by [[BBC Two]] presented by [[Victoria Derbyshire]] on Mondays to Wednesdays and generally by [[Annita McVeigh]] on the other two days of the week.

[[BBC Two]] often takes the News Channel programming on weekdays from 09:00 until 13:00 also simulcast on [[BBC World News]], when coverage switches to [[BBC One]] in the form of the simulcast [[BBC News at One]]. The BBC News at One may be broadcast on BBC One only however during periods of breaking news or major announcements in the [[House of Commons]] carried only on the News Channel, if it's an international story coverage will switch for the hour to simulcast with [[BBC World News]]. A similar arrangement applies for the [[BBC News at Six]], generally simulcast on both BBC One and the News Channel but, as ever, subject to change for breaking news for the News Channel.

The ''[[BBC News at Ten]]'' began simulcasting on the channel on 30 January 2006 as part of the ''Ten O'Clock Newshour'', followed by extended sport and business news updates. The bulletin was joined in being simulcast on 10 April 2006 when the ''[[BBC News at One]]'' (with [[British Sign Language]] in-vision signing) and ''[[BBC News at Six]]'' bulletins were added to the schedule following a similar format to the ''News at Ten'' in terms of content on the channel once each simulcast ends.

During the summer, the hour-long programme ''News 24 Sunday'' was broadcast both on BBC One and the BBC News Channel at 09:00, to replace ''[[The Andrew Marr Show]]'', which is off air. It was presented by a news presenter, and came from the main News channel studio. The programme was made up mostly of interviews focusing on current affairs, and included a full paper review, a weather summary, and a news update at 09:00, 09:30 and 10:00. ''[[Sunday Morning Live (BBC)|Sunday Morning Live]]'' and alternative programming now fill this slot.{{when|date=December 2018}}

From 2013, a new programme was created for [[BBC Two]] for 11:00–12:00 weekdays, consisting of 30 minutes of domestic news and 30 minutes of BBC World News.  On Wednesdays, when parliament is sitting the latter is replaced by the ''[[Daily Politics]]'' for coverage of [[Prime Minister's Questions]] (PMQ). In March 2016 the channel started showing ''[[Newsnight]]'' at 23:15.

The coverage from 10:00 to 13:00 on BBC Two and the News Channel is part of three-hour block of ''BBC World News'' simulcast due to the Coronavirus Pandemic. In turn, BBC World News produces the three-hour block between 19:00 to 22:00 and 22:30 to 06:00 on the channel and most coverage after the [[BBC News at Ten]], including one edition of [[the Papers]], is also shared with BBC World News. From August this was changed and made permanent to 10:00 to 12:00 and on weekdays 19:00 to 06:00, with opt-outs for BBC News at Ten and half an hour at 20:30, weekends 21:00 to 06:00, these exclude BBC One bulletin <ref name="bbc.co.uk"/>

Other News Channel presenters filled in across the week. The nightly editions are now presented by a presenter from BBC World News, and one edition simulcast on BBC World News. Croxall, and other presenters from the News Channel, do present the night-time ''Papers'' programmes as part of Saturday and Sunday evening shifts. The Sunday-morning edition continues to be presented usually by Ben Brown as part of the News Channel 09:00 to 14:00 shift.

It also now includes [[Victoria Derbyshire (TV programme)|Victoria Derbyshire]], which ran from 2015, the cancellation of which was announced by the BBC before the [[COVID-19 pandemic]] significantly impacted the UK.

==== 2015 schedule changes ====
As part of budget cuts, major changes to the channel were announced in late 2014/early 2015. This included axing some bulletins and replacing them with ''[[Victoria Derbyshire (TV programme)|Victoria Derbyshire]]'' and ''[[BBC Business Live]]'' with Sally Bundock and Ben Thompson in the morning. ''[[Outside Source]] with [[Ros Atkins]]'' – an "interactive" show already broadcast on BBC World News – aired Mondays-Thursday at (during major stories 18:00) and 21:00 and a new edition of ''[[World News Today]]'' Friday-Sunday at 21:00 (during major stories 19:00/20:00 Monday-Friday) adding to the 19:00 edition on [[BBC Four]]. ''[[HARDtalk]]'' was moved to 20:30 in May. The 00:00 edition was replaced on Sundays–Thursday with ''[[Newsday (programme)|Newsday]]'' and on Friday-Saturday a standard edition of ''[[BBC World News]]''.

==== BBC World News shared programming ====
This has now been expanded by the COVID-19 crisis. For a description, see above under BBC One, BBC Two and BBC World simulcasts. The following operates as a description prior to COVID-19.

Between 00:00–06:00 UK time, the channel simulcast with its sister channel, BBC World News, for the first 25 minutes of each hour with world news shown all through the simulcasts.

On 1 October 2007, BBC World News started broadcasting ''[[BBC World News America]]'' and ''[[World News Today]]'' at 00:00 and 03:00 GMT respectively. ''World News Today'' was simulcast on the BBC News channel at 03:00 GMT. ''BBC World News America'' used to be aired as a reduced length, [[Time shifting|time-delayed]] version at 00:30 GMT, with ''[[ABC World News Tonight]] with [[David Muir]]'' also being shown at 01:30 every Tuesday-Friday.

From 13 June 2011, the weekday editions of [[BBC News]] at 01:00, 02:00, 03:00 and 04:00 were replaced with ''[[Newsday (programme)|Newsday]]''. The programme acts as a morning news bulletin for the [[Asia-Pacific]] region and is broadcast as a double-headed news bulletin with [[Rico Hizon]] in [[Singapore]] and [[Babita Sharma]] in London. ''Asia Business Report'' and ''[[Sport Today]]'' are aired at the back of the first three hours of ''Newsday''. But Newsday changed to 23:00–02:00 on BBC News a year later meaning [[Mike Embley]] presents Tuesday-Friday ''BBC World News'' 23:00–02:00 with [[Kasia Madera]] on Saturdays and Daniela Ritorto 00:00–06:00 Sunday, 02:00–05:00 Friday/Monday.

''BBC World News'' and ''World Business Report'' air at 05:00. This was previously known as ''The World Today'', However, since November 2017 this was rebranded as ''The Briefing'' and ''Business Briefing'' on both channels and in lieu of commercials seen on the international broadcasts, the presenters gave a brief update on UK news for domestic audiences.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

In June 2015, BBC News began simulcasting ''Outside Source with Ros Atkins'' on Mondays-Thursday at (during major stories 18:00) / at 21:00 and a new edition of ''World News Today'' Friday-Sunday at (during major stories Monday-Friday 19:00) 21:00. Since January 2017, they began simulcasting ''Beyond 100 Days'' (previously '100 Days'' and ''100 Days +) Monday to Thursday at 19:00, presented from London and Washington. During August, ''Beyond 100 Days'' is replaced by another edition of  ''World News Today''.

Traditionally, during simulcasts in December, care has been taken to conceal the newsroom Christmas tree for international audiences. From 2015, the 21:00 bulletin has always been an edition of ''World News Today'', replacing ''Outside Source with Ros Atkins''.

=== Sports ===
Since 5 March 2012, sports bulletins come from the ''BBC Sport Centre'' in [[MediaCityUK]] in [[Salford Quays]], where the sports network [[BBC Radio 5 Live]] is also based.

Headlines are usually provided at 15 minutes past the hour with a full bulletin after the bottom-of-the-hour headlines. There are also extended sports bulletins per day, entitled ''Sportsday'' or ''Sport Today'' (when simulcasting with BBC World News) broadcast at 00:45, 01:45, 02:45, 03:45, 13:30, 18:30, 19:30 (weekends only), 22:30 (weekdays only). Each bulletin is read by a single sports presenter, with the exception of Saturday ''Sportsday'', which is double headed.

The channel's sports bulletins (internally known as Sport 24) have always had a separate, dedicated production gallery, which is also responsible for the graphics.

Bulletins during ''[[BBC Breakfast]]'' are presented by [[Sally Nugent]] or [[Mike Bushell]], with the latter also appearing on other sports bulletins on the channel. {{as of|2019|March|}} the main sports presenters on the channel are Olly Foster, [[Gavin Ramjaun]], Katie Gornall, Chetan Pathak, [[Katherine Downes]], [[Tulsen Tollett]], [[Lizzie Greenwood-Hughes]] and [[John Watson (sports presenter)|John Watson]].

Until March 2012 bulletins came from the News Channel studio at the quarter to the hour. Presenters for bulletins on the channel have included: [[Reshmin Chowdhury]], [[Amanda Davies]], [[Sean Fletcher]], Matt Gooderick, [[Celina Hinchcliffe]], [[Rachael Hodges]], [[Damian Johnson (broadcaster)|Damian Johnson]], [[Adnan Nawaz]] and Olympic gold medallist turned journalist [[Matthew Pinsent]].

=== Business ===
Before BBC News moved to Broadcasting House, an hourly business update was included during the weekday schedule from the BBC Business Unit. There were two shifts, from 08:30 to 14:00 and 14:00 to 23:00, presented by Penny Haslam, [[Maryam Moshiri]], Ben Thompson, [[Adam Parsons]], Susannah Streeter, [[Joe Lynam]], Sara Coburn or Sally Eden. News Channel updates were usually broadcast at 40 minutes past the hour between 08:00 and 23:00. The 21:40 round-up was often earlier and the 22:40 bulletin is an extended round-up of the day's business news. Until May 2009, the business updates on the BBC News Channel were broadcast from one of the [[London Stock Exchange]]'s studios in central London. From then until March 2013 the bulletins were provided from the channel's studio at [[BBC Television Centre]]. The business updates were axed in March 2013 as part of the BBC's Delivering Quality First plan. But after complaints returned in November 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/aboutthebbc/reports/pdf/dqf_newsandenglishregions.pdf |title=Delivering Quality First|work=BBC|access-date=19 March 2013}}</ref>

[[Sally Bundock]], Alice Baxter and Ben Thompson present ''Business Live'' and ''World Business Report''. [[Ros Atkins]] presents 'Outside Source'. Philippa Thomas, Alpa Patel, Karin Giannone or Kasia Madera present ''World News Today'' on Weekdays on [[BBC Four]] and weekends on the channel. [[Rico Hizon]] and [[Sharanjit Leyl]] (Reporting from Singapore), [[Babita Sharma]] and Madera are the main overnight presenters on the channel, appearing on ''Newsday'' and generic BBC News bulletins. These programmes are simulcast with [[BBC World News]] and either [[BBC One]] or [[BBC Two]]. Madera, [[Ben Bland]] and [[Mike Embley]] regularly present 02:00–05:00 weekdays and 01:00–06:00 weekends. Bundock or [[David Eades]] present ''The Briefing'' and ''Business Briefing'' on weekday mornings on the channel and [[BBC One]].

The simulcasting of the main national news bulletins has led to the presenters of those bulletins appearing on the channel and offer relief on the news channel including Huw Edwards, [[Victoria Derbyshire]], [[Fiona Bruce]], [[George Alagiah]], [[Sophie Raworth]], [[Kate Silverton]] and [[Mishal Husain]]. The main ''[[BBC Breakfast|Breakfast]]'' presenters have also appeared on the channel since it was first launched as a simulcast programme in 2000, with the current presenters being [[Dan Walker (broadcaster)|Dan Walker]], [[Louise Minchin]], [[Charlie Stayt]] and Naga Munchetty.

Thomas presents the BBC World News programme [[Reporters (BBC News programme)|Reporters]] on the channel, while [[Gavin Esler]] presents ''[[Dateline London]]''. [[Stephen Sackur]] appears on ''[[HARDtalk]]'', which is aired weeknights and at weekends, while [[Zeinab Badawi]], Carrie Gracie and [[Sarah Montague]] provide cover for him. [[Spencer Kelly]] presents the technology news programme ''[[Click (TV programme)|Click]]''. ''[[Newsnight]]'' host [[Evan Davis]] presents ''The Bottom Line''. [[Lee McKenzie]] presents ''Inside F1'' on Grand Prix weekend's. [[Tanya Beckett]] presents ''Talking Business'' and ''Witness''. [[Ade Adepitan]], Rajan Datar, Christa Larwood, Henry Golding and Carmen Robert present ''[[The Travel Show (BBC TV series)|The Travel Show]]''

During a major news event one or more of the main news presenters may be sent to present live for the channel from the scene of the story, where they will conduct interviews with the people involved, question correspondents, introduce related reports and also give general information on the story, much as a reporter sent to cover a story would. The presenters often have expertise in the story they are sent to cover, for example channel presenters and former reporters Ben Brown and Clive Myrie were dispatched to [[Cairo]] and [[Tripoli]] during the Middle East uprisings.

=== Graphics ===
{{Listen|filename=Bbc news theme 2007.ogg
| title=BBC News theme|description=The BBC News title music by [[David Lowe (television and radio composer)|David Lowe]]}}
The channel was criticised at launch for its style of presentation, with accusations of it being less authoritative than the BBC One news bulletins, with presenters appearing on-screen without jackets. [[Jenny Abramsky]] had originally planned to have a television version of the informal news radio channel [[BBC Radio 5 Live]], or a TV version of [[Radio 4 News FM]] both of which she had run. The bright design of the set was also blamed for this – one insider reportedly described it as a "car crash in a shower"<ref name = "kcvcng"/> – and was subject to the network relaunch on 25 October 1999. The channel swapped studios with sister channel BBC World, moving to studio N8 within the newsroom, where it remained until 2008. New music and title sequences accompanied this set change, following the look of newly relaunched BBC One bulletins.

Graphics and titles were developed by the [[Lambie-Nairn]] design agency and were gradually rolled out across the whole of BBC News, including a similar design for regional news starting with ''[[Newsroom South East]]'' and the three 'BBC Nations' – [[BBC Scotland|Scotland]], [[BBC Wales|Wales]] and [[BBC Northern Ireland|Northern Ireland]]. The similarity of main BBC News output was intended to increase the credibility of the channel as well as aiding cross-channel promotion.<ref name="aboutN24">[https://web.archive.org/web/20040404035846/http://tvhome.co.uk/bbcnews24/about.phtml About BBC News] TV Home</ref>

A graphics relaunch in January 2007 saw the channel updated, with redesigned headline straplines, a redesigned '[[digital on-screen graphic]]' and repositioned clock. The clock was originally placed to the left hand side of the channel name though following complaints that this could only be viewed in widescreen, it was moved to the right in February 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/theeditors/2007/01/fine_tuning.html|title=BBC News – The Editors – Fine tuning|date=22 January 2007}}</ref> Bulletins on BBC World News and BBC One also introduced similar graphics and title sequences on the same day.

In 2008, the graphics were again relaunched, using the style introduced in 2007 and a new colour scheme. The typeface of the on-screen text was changed from Helvetica to Gill Sans.

In 2013 the graphics were changed again, to coincide with the move to New Broadcasting House. The typeface was changed back to Helvetica.

These were updated again in July 2019 when the BBC redesigned its on-air look with the growth of Television viewing on Smartphones and Tablets. These included again redesigned, larger headline straplines sharply contrasting with the background (drawing criticism for obscuring content) using the BBC Reith typeface with larger text. Despite this, the 2008 titles and music continue to be used for the updated Local titles.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/aboutthebbc/entries/4df3e9ba-bdf7-48dc-8c9e-0c4256cce7f6|title=TV news graphics: a new look|date=15 July 2019|website=BBC|language=en|access-date=15 July 2019}}</ref>

=== The Lambert Report ===
The Lambert Report into the channel's performance in 2002 called upon News 24 to develop a better brand of its own, to allow viewers to differentiate between itself and similar channels such as [[Sky News]]. As a direct result of this, a brand new style across all presentation for the channel launched on 8 December 2003 at 09:00. [[Philip Hayton]] and [[Anna Jones (journalist)|Anna Jones]] were the first two presenters on the set, the relaunch of which had been put back a week due to previous power disruptions at Television Centre where the channel was based. The new designs also featured a dynamic set of titles for the channel; the globe would begin spinning from where the main story was taking place, while the headline scrolled around in a ribbon; this was occasionally replaced by the BBC News logo. The titles concluded with a red globe surrounded by a red stylised clamshell and BBC News ribbons forming above the BBC News logo.

Bulletins on BBC One moved into a new set in January 2003 although retained the previous ivory Lambie-Nairn titles until February 2004. News 24 updated the title colours slightly to match those of BBC One bulletins in time for the 50th anniversary of BBC television news on 5 July 2004.<ref>[http://www.tvradiobits.co.uk/idents/news24b.htm BBC News 24 2003–08]{{dead link|date=February 2013}} TV & Radio Bits</ref>

=== Countdown sequence ===
[[File:BBC News channel countdown.png|thumb|The countdown since 2005 has shown the elements of journalism and production involved in bringing news stories to air.]]

An important part of the channel's presentation since launch has been the top of the hour countdown sequence, since there is no presentation system with continuity announcers so the countdown provides a link to the beginning of the next hour. A similar musical device is used on [[BBC Radio 5 Live]], and mirrors the [[BBC pips|pips]] on [[BBC Radio 4]].

Previous styles have included a series of fictional flags set to music between 1997 and 1999 before the major relaunch, incorporating the new contemporary music composed by [[David Lowe (television and radio composer)|David Lowe]], and graphics developed by [[Lambie-Nairn]]. Various images, originally ivory numbers fully animated against a deep red background, were designed to fit the pace of the channel, and the music soon gained notoriety, and was often satirised and parodied in popular culture, perhaps most famously by comic [[Bill Bailey]] who likened the theme music to an "apocalyptic [[rave]]". Images of life around the UK were added in replacement later with the same music, together with footage of the newsroom and exterior of Television Centre. The 2003 relaunch saw a small change to this style with less of a metropolitan feel to the footage.

A new sequence was introduced on 28 March 2005, designed and created by [[Red Bee Media]] and directed by Mark Chaudoir. The full version ran for 60 seconds, though only around 30 seconds were usually shown on air. The music was revised completely but the biggest change came in the footage used – reflecting the methods and nature of newsgathering, while a strong emphasis was placed on the BBC logo itself. Satellite dishes are shown transmitting and receiving red "data streams". In production of the countdown sequence, Clive Norman filmed images around the United Kingdom, Richard Jopson in the United States, while BBC News cameramen filmed images from [[Iraq]], Beijing ([[Tiananmen Square]]), [[Bund of Shanghai]], Africa, as well as areas affected by the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami|2004 Asian tsunami]] and others.

The sequence has since seen several remixes to the music and a change in visuals to focus more on the well-known journalists, with less footage of camera crews and production teams. Changes have also seen the channel logo included during the sequences and at the end, as well as the fonts used for the time. The conclusion of the countdown was altered in 2008 to feature the new presentation style, rather than a data stream moving in towards the camera. Also in 2008, the graphic for the countdown changed, resembling BBC One Rhythm and Movement Idents, due to the logo being in a red square in inferior-left corner.

To coincide with the move of BBC News to [[Broadcasting House#Second phase|Broadcasting House]], on 18 March 2013 the countdown was updated again along with several other presentation elements. Three of the most striking features of the new countdown include music performed by the [[BBC Concert Orchestra]], a redesign of the "data streams" and the ending of the sequence no longer fading to the BBC News globe and logo, but instead stopping with a time-lapse shot outside the corporation's headquarters. The countdown was also extended to 87 seconds, which was fully shown before the first hour from Broadcasting House.

A full three-minute version of the countdown music was made available on [[BBC News Online]] and David Lowe's own website after a remix on 16 May 2006.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/talking_point/4992088.stm News 24 'releases' countdown music] – BBC News Online, 18 May 2006 {{Update inline|date=December 2016}}</ref>

An international version of the countdown was launched on BBC World News on 5 September 2005 featuring more international content and similar music. Various changes have been made to the music and visuals since then, with presentation following the style of BBC News. The visuals in the sequence were updated on 10 May 2010. In June 2011, further imagery was added relating to recent events, including the conflict in Libya and views of outside 10 Downing Street. In January 2013, as part of the relocation of BBC News to [[Broadcasting House#Second phase|Broadcasting House]] in Central London, BBC World News received a new countdown in the same style as the BBC News Channel's updated countdown, with some minor differences.

'''BBC Parliament''' is a British [[free-to-air]] television channel which broadcasts live and recorded coverage of the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], [[House of Lords]] and [[Parliamentary select committees of the United Kingdom|Select Committees]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]], the [[Scottish Parliament]], the [[London Assembly]], the [[Northern Ireland Assembly]] and the [[Senedd Cymru – Welsh Parliament|Senedd]]. On average, 1.2% of the UK's total population watch the channel for more than three minutes at least once per week; these viewers watch for an average of just over two hours each over the course of the week.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/annualreport/2012/exec/overview/performance/|title=BBC Trust annual report 2011/12|access-date=20 December 2019|archive-date=4 June 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130604085131/http://www.bbc.co.uk/annualreport/2012/exec/overview/performance/|url-status=dead}}</ref>

== History ==
{{Further|Timeline of BBC Parliament}}

Before being taken over by the BBC, the channel was known as the Parliamentary Channel, operated by United Artists Cable and funded by a consortium of British cable operators.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199798/cmselect/cmbroad/984/8071504.htm|title=House of Commons – Broadcasting – Minutes of Evidence|website=publications.parliament.uk}}</ref> The Parliamentary Channel launched as a cable-exclusive channel on 13 January 1992. The channel was purchased by the BBC in 1998, retitled BBC Parliament and relaunched on 23 September 1998. It now broadcasts on cable, satellite, and [[Freeview (UK)|Freeview]].

The channel ran as an audio service via [[Digital Audio Broadcasting|DAB]] from launch until 14 November 2000.

Due to capacity limitations on the [[digital terrestrial television]] platform, now known as [[Freeview (UK)|Freeview]], from launch until 30 October 2002, the channel ran as "audio only". Then on Freeview from October 2002 until 13 November 2006 the channel was only able to broadcast a quarter-screen picture. After receiving "thousands of angry and perplexed [[email]]s and letters",<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/theeditors/2006/10/resizing_parliament.html|title=BBC NEWS – The Editors|access-date=30 April 2007}}</ref> not to mention questions asked by MPs in the House itself, the BBC eventually found the [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] to make the channel full-screen.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/bbc_parliament/6144072.stm|title=BBC NEWS – Programmes – BBC Parliament – BBC Parliament goes full screen|access-date=30 April 2007 | date=13 November 2006|work=BBC News}}</ref>

Until 2008, BBC Parliament was unique amongst the BBC channels in being broadcast using non-BBC facilities, with ITV's Millbank Studios in [[Westminster]] supplying the engineering and [[playout]] facilities. Production, editorial and journalism were, however, maintained by the BBC.

The previous idents, also based on a Big Ben clock motif ran from 2009 to 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2009/04_april/16/parliament.shtml|title=BBC – Press Office – BBC Parliament gets a fresh look|work=bbc.co.uk}}</ref> This replaced the channel's previous identity which was first introduced in 2002.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/bbc_parliament/8008077.stm|title=BBC NEWS – Programmes – BBC Parliament – BBC Parliament unveils a fresh new look|work=bbc.co.uk|date=20 April 2009}}</ref>

BBC Parliament was taken off the air during the [[2012 Summer Olympics]] on [[Freeview (UK)|Freeview]] in post-[[Digital television transition|digital switchover]] areas to enable BBC Three to broadcast 24 hours a day. The BBC had done the same during the [[2008 Summer Olympics]] as it used the space to provide an additional [[BBC Red Button]] option for Freeview users.

BBC Parliament HD has been confirmed as launching from 20 October 2021 and rolling out across various platforms at different times right up to the end of 2022, the standard definition service will continue on Freeview. This has been the case since 10 December 2013 when [[BBC Three]], [[BBC Four]], [[BBC News]], [[CBBC (TV channel)|CBBC]], and [[Cbeebies]] began high definition [[simulcast]]s.<ref>{{cite web|last1=O'malley|first1=James|title=The BBC are launching five new HD channels… tomorrow!|url=http://www.techdigest.tv/2013/12/the_bbc_are_lau.html|publisher=techdigest.tv|access-date=8 February 2017|date=9 December 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180420075258/https://www.techdigest.tv/2013/12/the_bbc_are_lau.html|archive-date=20 April 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/articles/2021/bbc-one-hd-rollout-england|title = Rolling out BBC One in high definition across England}}</ref>

On 5 September 2016 [[BBC Two]] began broadcasting BBC Parliament during BBC Two's overnight downtime.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cableforum.co.uk/board/showthread.php?t=33703527|title=BBC Parliament coming to BBC2|access-date=8 September 2016|date=27 August 2016|work=Cableforum.co.uk|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160917105318/http://www.cableforum.co.uk/board/showthread.php?t=33703527|archive-date=17 September 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> However this was short-lived and has subsequently been discontinued.

On 14 October 2016, the channel received a new look and new idents, its first revamp since 2009. The channel's current identity went live on Monday 10 October 2016 with refreshed music and idents based on clock workings, with colours and images derived from the flags and assemblies of the British home countries and the European Parliament.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b080kjhr|title=BBC Parliament – Launch of BBC Parliament's New Look|website=BBC}}</ref>

In July 2018, the BBC announced that the output on the channel was to be cut back, discontinuing all programming produced for the channel other than parliamentary coverage, and closing the channel entirely during summer months when Parliament and the devolved assemblies are not sitting.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2018/bbc-announces-changes-to-political-programming|title=BBC – BBC announces changes to political programming – Media Centre|website=bbc.co.uk}}</ref> The move has been criticised by many<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.libdemvoice.org/now-is-not-the-time-for-the-bbc-to-be-cutting-back-its-political-programmes-58065.html|title=Now is not the time for the BBC to be cutting back its political programmes|access-date=15 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190730155152/https://www.libdemvoice.org/now-is-not-the-time-for-the-bbc-to-be-cutting-back-its-political-programmes-58065.html|archive-date=30 July 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref> including the former [[Speaker of the House of Commons (United Kingdom)|House of Commons Speaker]] [[John Bercow]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/sep/18/dont-cut-bbc-parliament-bercow-urges-corporation|title=Don't cut BBC Parliament, Bercow urges corporation|first=Pippa Crerar Deputy political|last=editor|date=18 September 2018|via=www.theguardian.com}}</ref> In October 2018, the BBC announced that it had shelved these plans.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-45810822|title=BBC Parliament programme cuts reversed|work=BBC News|date=10 October 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/articles/2021/bbc-one-hd-rollout-england|title = Rolling out BBC One in high definition across England}}</ref>

From 26 July until 31 August 2021, BBC Parliament simulcast the [[BBC News Channel]] during a parliamentary recess.<ref>[https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/schedules/service_bbc_parliament/2021-07-26 BBC Programme Guide - BBC Parliament 26 July 2021]</ref> This was the first time the channel had done this – previously, BBC Parliament broadcast highlights from the previous session during recesses. This is being seen as part of a range of cutbacks to the channel which also sees the end of coverage of party conferences as well as the ending of ''The Day in Parliament''&nbsp;and&nbsp;''The Week in Parliament''. Coverage of the [[House of Lords]] and Select committees is also significantly reduced.<ref>[https://cleanfeed.thetvroom.com/9170/preswatch/bbc-parliament-relays-bbc-news-channel-during-recess/ BBC Parliament relays BBC News Channel during recess]</ref> Also, the Sunday broadcasts of national political shows, [[C-Span]] and a repeat of ''[[Question Time (TV programme)|Question Time]]'' have stopped. Consequently, the channel now operates a 24-hour schedule consisting of nothing other than live and recorded coverage from Westminster and the devolved chambers.

== Programming ==

=== Regular programming ===
Whenever the House of Commons is sitting, BBC Parliament carries the chamber live without interruption, with any simultaneous House of Lords sitting being shown in full later the same day and the following morning, often in sections that fit around the sittings of the Commons. The House of Lords is broadcast live only on days when there is no House of Commons sitting scheduled. BBC Parliament also provides full, recorded coverage of the House of Commons' second chamber [[Westminster Hall]] during weekends, when they will also broadcast selected evidence sessions from different [[Select committees of the Parliament of the United Kingdom|select committees]] of the House of Commons.

Whenever both Westminster chambers are in recess, but a devolved assembly is constituted, the channel will provide live coverage of its work, while during Westminster sessions, coverage of the devolved assemblies usually takes the form of highlights at the weekend of the previous week's main debates and business.

Thus, when taken together with both live and recorded coverage from the other bodies it covers, BBC Parliament's schedule is dominated by direct broadcasts of the legislative and political institutions, whether they be plenary, quasi-plenary (such as [[Westminster Hall]]), or in committees that affect British public life.

BBC Parliament also shows a variety of other recorded programmes, both made especially for the channel, and from across the BBC's national and international channels, including:

* '''''BOOKtalk''''' – face-to-face discussion with authors about recently released political books, presented by Mark D'Arcy. A summer special is also produced featuring several 'beach books'.
* '''''Briefings''''' – a strand of programmes, usually broadcast weekend evenings, containing recorded coverage of major press briefings and conferences given by politicians in the previous week.
* '''''Dragon's Eye''''' (produced by [[BBC Wales]]) – presented by [[Adrian Masters]] or [[Rhun ap Iorwerth]], providing a weekly roundup of Welsh political developments (since replaced by the Welsh section of '''''Sunday Politics''''').
* '''''[[Eòrpa]]''''' (produced by [[BBC Gàidhlig]]) – current affairs series which covers political and social developments covering Europe, transmitted in [[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]] with English subtitles.
* '''''Hearts and Minds''''' (produced by [[BBC Northern Ireland]]) – weekly programme covering the latest issues in the politics of Northern Ireland (since replaced by the Northern Irish section of '''''Sunday Politics''''').
*'''''Lords Questions''''' – recorded coverage of the most recent session of Questions in the House of Lords.
* '''''Mayor's Question Time''''' – recorded coverage of the monthly question period in the [[London Assembly]] to the [[Mayor of London]].
*'''''[[Politics Europe]]''''' – monthly programme usually broadcast on a Friday which covers the latest political news across Europe, analysing both the situation in Brussels as well as within individual European nations. Filmed in exactly the same format as the [[Daily Politics]], presented by [[Andrew Neil]] or [[Jo Coburn]]. Also broadcast on [[BBC World News]].
* '''''[[Politics Live]]''''' – a daily political programme broadcast live weekdays on [[BBC Two]] at 12:15&nbsp;pm during parliamentary sessions and presented by [[Andrew Neil]] and [[Jo Coburn]]. ''Politics Live'' discusses the latest political guests and talk about the day events across the United Kingdom, and is repeated on BBC Parliament every night at midnight. The '''''Sunday Politics''''' from BBC One (including the London region opt-out section) is also repeated at midnight on the day of broadcast.
*'''''[[Prime Minister's Questions]]''''' – recorded coverage of the most recent session of Prime Minister's Questions in the House of Commons. Live coverage is also provided on the channel without comment or interruption as part of the channel's live coverage of the House of Commons' sittings.
* '''''[[Question Time (TV series)|Question Time]]''''' (repeated from [[BBC One]]) – a topical debate programme based on [[Any Questions?]] which typically features politicians from at least the three major political parties as well as other public figures who answer questions put to them by the audience. Repeated on BBC Parliament every Sunday at 6&nbsp;pm.
*'''''[[First Minister's Questions (Scottish Parliament)|Scottish First Minister's Questions]]''''' – recorded coverage of the most recent session of Questions to the [[First Minister of Scotland]] in the [[Scottish Parliament]]. Scottish First Minister's Questions is broadcast on Thursday evenings at 11:30&nbsp;pm, and is repeated throughout the week.
* '''''[[Sunday Politics#Sunday Politics Scotland|Sunday Politics Scotland]]'' ''' (produced by [[BBC Scotland]]) – the Scottish section of ''[[The Sunday Politics]]'', presented by [[Gordon Brewer]] and transmitted on [[BBC One Scotland]].
*'''''[[Ten Minute Rule|Ten Minute Rule Bill]]''''' – Recorded coverage of a backbench MP seeking the leave of the House of Commons to introduce a piece of legislation on a specific topic under the rules of Standing Order 23.
* '''''The Day in Parliament''''' – nightly programme, broadcast at 11&nbsp;pm, or following the adjournment of the House of Commons if it sits after that time, that rounds up the day's headlines from across all of the UK's legislative chambers. ''The Record'' is usually presented by Keith McDougall, Alicia McCarthy, David Cornock, Mandy Baker or Kristina Cooper.
* '''''The Week in Parliament''''' – a weekly 30-minute-long analysis and discussion of major events in the UK's legislative chambers. Special editions of the record are produced during Westminster recesses reviewing the preceding session, and at the end of the calendar year reviewing the previous 12 months. The weekly edition is presented by either Keith McDougall, David Cornock, Mandy Baker, Kristina Cooper and Alicia McCarthy, and the special editions are often presented jointly by McDougall and McCarthy.
* '''''The World Debate''''' – part of a selection of programmes originally transmitted on [[BBC World News]], that are broadcast exclusively on BBC Parliament to UK audiences, such as the 2009 London [[Intelligence Squared]] debates.
* '''''[[Washington Journal]]''''' (from [[C-SPAN]]) – providing a lookback at the week in American politics, and providing the opportunity for UK viewers to contribute to a phone-in debate.
*'''''[[First Minister's Question Time|Welsh First Minister's Questions]]''''' – recorded coverage of the most recent session of Questions to the [[First Minister of Wales]] in the [[Senedd Cymru – Welsh Parliament]]. Welsh First Minister's Questions is always broadcast on Tuesday evenings at 11:30&nbsp;pm, and is then repeated throughout the week.

BBC Parliament also broadcasts the annual party conferences of the UK's major political parties in full, highlights of the smaller party conferences, highlights of the [[General Synod of the Church of England]], live coverage of the annual chamber sitting of the [[UK Youth Parliament]] in the House of Commons, oral evidence sessions from the [[British Youth Council]]'s Youth [[Select committee (United Kingdom)|Select Committee]], and the annual [[House of Lords]] Chamber Event.

==== Election night ====
In the event of one of the devolved nations producing their own results programme on election night, normally the first Thursday in May, BBC Parliament will usually broadcast this telecast to the whole of the United Kingdom. On election night for the [[2005 United Kingdom general election|2005]], [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010]], [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015]] and [[2017 United Kingdom general election|2017]] general elections, BBC Parliament aired [[BBC Scotland]]'s result night coverage.  A few days afterwards, it would also broadcast a replay of election night coverage from BBC Wales and BBC Northern Ireland. It also took BBC Scotland's coverage of both the [[2011 Scottish Parliament election|2011 devolved assembly elections]] and Scottish Independence Referendum.  In March 2011 BBC Parliament simulcast [[BBC Wales]]'s results coverage of the [[2011 Welsh devolution referendum|nation's devolution referendum]].

==== Original Programmes ====
Until July 2021, BBC Parliament had often broadcast its own original programmes. They were either be scheduled or used to fill any gaps in the billed programmes, especially when live coverage of a legislative chamber ends before the next programme is due to start. The programmes covered a variety of political and parliamentary subjects, including:

*'''''A to Z of Westminster''''' – A series of short programmes presented by BBC Parliament researchers that seek to explain some of the more common aspects of parliamentary protocol.
*'''''[[Britain's Best Buildings]]''''' – Only the episode that features the [[Palace of Westminster]] is broadcast, usually edited down into short segments that focus on one specific feature of the palace.
*'''''Election File''''' – Short summaries of previous general election results, including short bursts of the BBC's original television coverage. These files are now rarely shown.
*'''''In House''''' – A new strand of programmes that replaced ''A-Z of Westminster'' in 2011. The programmes are similar in function to their predecessor series, seeking to explain some of the strange procedures that occur in Parliament.
*'''''Laying Down the Law''''' – A standalone programme that explains the parliamentary stages a bill must go through to become an Act of Parliament.
*'''''MP Too!''''' – A series of short programmes that look back at some eighteenth and nineteenth centuries [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Members of Parliament]] (MPs) who were more famous for their work outside of the House of Commons or House of Lords.
*'''''Village Idioms''''' – Short examinations of modern-day [[idioms]] that were coined in Westminster, including 'reading the [[Riot Act]]' and 'flogging a dead horse'.
* '''''Laws and Ladies''''' – A topical chat show, featuring a panel of peers discussing the political issues of the day. Those appearing are [[Betty Boothroyd|Baroness Boothroyd]], [[Jill Knight|Baroness Knight of Collingtree]] and [[Brenda Dean, Baroness Dean of Thornton-le-Fylde|Baroness Dean of Thornton-le-Fylde.]]

=== Archive and special programming ===

==== General election and referendum repeats ====
Since 2002, the channel has frequently shown recordings of BBC [[general election]] coverage, from the [[1955 United Kingdom general election|1955 election]], the first British election programme to be [[telerecording|telerecorded]] as well as other events such as the [[1975 United Kingdom European Communities membership referendum|1975 EEC Referendum]] and the [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|2016 EU Referendum]]. Some have been broadcast on the anniversary of their original transmissions. The channel's editor has described this as adding "something of value" and says it helps the channel "reach a wider audience for our normal parliamentary schedule".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/theeditors/2007/05/narrowest_niche.html|title=BBC NEWS – The Editors|access-date=8 May 2007| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070527181618/http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/theeditors/2007/05/narrowest_niche.html#commentsanchor| archive-date= 27 May 2007 | url-status= live}}</ref>

==== Special programming ====
Since 2002 BBC Parliament has broadcast programmes that have a historical or broader social significance, often encompassing major events both in the United Kingdom and in the world. They have also included a selection of programmes exploring issues of import and topicality in-depth, akin to [[BBC Four]]. They are generally shown on the anniversaries of major events. Programmes in this area have been diverse in character, such as the channel's first archive rerun, which was to celebrate the [[Golden Jubilee of Elizabeth II|Golden Jubilee]] in June 2002 when BBC Parliament reran the [[Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II|coronation coverage]].

===== 2005–2006 =====
In 2005, the channel marked the 40th anniversary of the death of Winston Churchill by broadcasting archive coverage of his funeral.

Also in 2005, BBC Parliament also marked the 30th anniversary of the [[1975 United Kingdom European Communities membership referendum|first referendum over Europe]] by reshowing interviews with the two main party leaders, and broadcasting the two hours of the Referendum results coverage which the BBC retains in its archives.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/schedules/bbcparliament/2005-06-05|title=BBC Parliament – 5 June 2005 – BBC Genome|website=genome.ch.bbc.co.uk}}</ref>

The 50th anniversary of the [[Suez Crisis]] was commemorated in November 2006, with writer and broadcaster [[Anthony Howard (journalist)|Anthony Howard]] introducing a special series of programmes on the channel. This included television broadcasts by the then-prime minister [[Anthony Eden]] and the then-Labour Leader of the Opposition [[Hugh Gaitskell]], alongside a new documentary called ''Suez in Parliament: a Fine Hullabaloo''.

===== 2007–2008 =====
On 1 April 2007,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/schedules/bbcparliament/2007-04-01|title=BBC Parliament – 1 April 2007 – BBC Genome|website=genome.ch.bbc.co.uk|access-date=25 July 2017}}</ref> veteran BBC correspondent [[Brian Hanrahan]] introduced ''Falklands Night'' to mark the 25th anniversary of the outbreak of the [[Falklands War]]. Programming included the BBC's original television news bulletins and reports from the period, alongside editions of ''[[Newsnight]]'' and excerpts of debates from ''Question Time''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/schedules/bbcparliament/2007-04-01|title=BBC Parliament – 1 April 2007 – BBC Genome|website=genome.ch.bbc.co.uk}}</ref> ''Falklands Night'' was shown twice during the spring of 2007 to mark the beginning and the end of the conflict.

On 1 July 2007, the channel broadcast ''Hong Kong Night'', presented by [[Chris Patten]], the last [[Governor of Hong Kong]], which reran coverage of the [[Hong Kong handover ceremony|handover ceremony]], to coincide with the tenth anniversary of the end of British rule, and the [[transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong]] to China.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/schedules/bbcparliament/2007-07-01|title=BBC Parliament – 1 July 2007 – BBC Genome|website=genome.ch.bbc.co.uk}}</ref>

The 10th anniversary of the [[death of Diana, Princess of Wales]] was marked on 1 September 2007 with a broadcast of the BBC coverage of her funeral. The rerun was shown at the precise broadcast times of the BBC's original coverage, running from 8:25&nbsp;am until 4:00&nbsp;pm. [[David Dimbleby]], who anchored the BBC's coverage, said a few words at the beginning and end of the rerun.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/schedules/bbcparliament/2007-09-01|title=BBC Parliament – 1 September 2007 – BBC Genome|website=genome.ch.bbc.co.uk}}</ref>

[[Cliff Michelmore]] came out of retirement on 18 November 2007 to present ''The Pound in Your Pocket'', a special strand of programming to mark forty years since the [[devaluation]] of the [[Pound sterling|Pound]] by the British government on 18 November 1967.

'''CBBC''' (short for '''Children's BBC''', also known as the '''CBBC Channel''') is a British [[free-to-air]] [[children's television]] channel owned and operated by the [[BBC]] and the brand used for all BBC content for children and teenagers aged 6 to 17.<ref>{{cite web|title=CBBC Service License|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/bbctrust/assets/files/pdf/regulatory_framework/service_licences/tv/2010/cbbc_may10.pdf|publisher=BBC Trust|access-date=11 October 2011}}</ref>

==History==
CBBC was first developed in 1985 as an educational block in the UK by the [[BBC]].

Launched in 2002 alongside its sister channel, [[CBeebies]], which serves the under eight audience, the name was previously used to brand all [[BBC Children's and Education|BBC Children's]] content. CBBC broadcasts for fourteen hours per-day from 7:00&nbsp;am to 9:00&nbsp;pm. CBBC was named Channel of the Year at the Children's [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]] awards in November 2008 and 2012 and 2015. The channel averages 300,000 viewers daily.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/7758184.stm|title=Bafta honour for Chuckle Brothers|work=BBC News|date=December 2008}}</ref>

The channel originally shared bandwidth on the [[Freeview (UK)|digital terrestrial television]] platform with [[BBC Choice]],<ref>{{cite news|work=Digital Spy|access-date=18 July 2007|date=9 September 2002|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/british-tv/news/a6198/new-childrens-channels-from-bbc-launch.html|title=New children's channels from BBC launch}}</ref> and later [[BBC Three]], needing that CBBC sign off at 7:00&nbsp;p.m. daily. Beginning on 11 April 2016, following the closure of the linear BBC Three television service, CBBC extended its broadcast day by two hours.<ref name="newsround-extended">{{cite news|title=CBBC gets two extra hours on TV|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/newsround/36014791|website=BBC Newsround|access-date=16 May 2016}}</ref><ref name="guardian-cbbcextend">{{cite news|title=BBC Trust tells parents unhappy at CBBC's late finish: 'there is an off button'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/nov/26/bbc-tells-parents-unhappy-cbbc-late-finish-off-button|access-date=16 February 2016|work=The Guardian}}</ref> On 22 August 2008, the BBC announced that the channel would be available live on its website from 16 September.<ref>{{cite news|title=BBC Four, CBBC and CBeebies to simulcast online|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2008/08_august/22/simulcast.shtml|access-date=11 October 2011|newspaper=BBC Press Office|date=22 August 2008}}</ref> CBBC's reach further expanded with the addition of the channel on the [[Sky UK|Sky]] line-up in Ireland on 12 May 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theairwaves.net/channelnews/4399-ireland-extra-bbc-channels-being-added-to-sky-epg |title=Ireland: Extra BBC channels being added to Sky EPG |publisher=The Airwaves |date=2 May 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110507070203/http://www.theairwaves.net/channelnews/4399-ireland-extra-bbc-channels-being-added-to-sky-epg |archive-date=7 May 2011 }}</ref> The [[British Forces Broadcasting Service]] have provided younger viewers with CBBC and CBeebies since 1 April 2013 when they replaced <abbr>[[British Forces Broadcasting Service|BFBS]]</abbr> Kids.

From January 2022, the channel's broadcast hours will be reduced by two hours, closing at 7{{nbsp}}p.m. as was the case pre-2016. The move is to make way for the return of [[BBC Three]] to linear broadcast television.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/amp/entertainment-arts-56251020|date=2 March 2021|title=BBC Three will return to TV screens after six-year break}}</ref>

==Management==
Along with [[CBeebies]], CBBC is operated by the [[BBC Children's and Education]] department. BBC Children's was originally based in the East Tower of [[Television Centre, London|BBC Television Centre]] since the department's inception, but moved to [[MediaCityUK]] in [[Salford, Greater Manchester|Salford]] in September 2011, and the live presentation links used throughout the day are now recorded and broadcast from there.

CBBC's programming output is very similar to the strand previously shown on BBC One. CBBC often complements this strand with programmes shown earlier than on the terrestrial channels, repeats or whole series shown in a day,{{citation needed|date=March 2021}} alongside other exclusive commissions.

===Class TV===
As part of CBBC's original remit, CBBC needed to show over 1,000 hours a year of factual and schools programmes.<ref name="Remit06">{{cite web|title=CBBC Service License 2006|url=http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/bbctrust/assets/files/pdf/regulatory_framework/service_licences/tv/tv_servicelicences/cbbc_servicelicence_18dec2006.pdf|publisher=BBC Trust|access-date=22 November 2021}}</ref> The service managed this by introducing the ''Class TV'' strand to CBBC, which would air educational programming for approximately two hours each day in the late morning, with normal programming resuming in the early afternoon. Much of this programming was old [[BBC Schools]] programming shown, in some cases, decades before and which was for the most part still relevant. Very little new schools programmes were commissioned. Class TV ended in April 2010, following a change to CBBC's remit. However, in December 2019, CBBC brought back Class TV with 'Live Lessons' presented by the CBBC presenting team on late weekday mornings.

Due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom]] and the closure of schools around the country during the first & third national lockdowns, CBBC broadcast shows from the [[Bitesize|BBC Bitesize]] service for [[primary school|primary-school]]-aged children. These shows featured a mix of archive, live and newly filmed content. Many CBBC TV shows played regular repeats from old episodes, however the children's magazine TV show [[Blue Peter]] still aired on Thursdays. Changes was made to [[Blue Peter]] and weekly live episodes stopped due to [[COVID-19]] . Blue Peter in 2020 had a new presenter [[Adam Beales]] known as Adam B who is also a YouTuber and actor. This was to attract more children to the children's magazine show during the [[COVID-19 pandemic]] and also to the CBBC.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-55552962|title=BBC to put lessons on TV during lockdown|work=[[BBC News]]|date=5 January 2021}}</ref>

==Presentation==
{{see also|BBC Children's idents}}
CBBC has had a relatively similar presentation to that of its strand counterpart. The logo has consistently remained the same until 2016 as the service; green coloured blobs at the beginning of its life and the green and white logo from September 2007 until now. The logo today is all different colours unlike the last one. CBBC has mainly utilised presenters from the main service, with a few presenters appearing mostly on the new channel; [[Gemma Hunt]] and [[Anne Foy]] being notable examples and appearing consistently until August 2007. At the beginning of September 2007, along with the relaunch, the same presenters of CBBC would also feature on CBBC on BBC One and Two.

When CBBC launched, presentation was located in [[TC1 studio|TC2]] at [[Television Centre, London|BBC Television Centre]], where the channel shared studio facilities with CBBC's original magazine show ''[[Xchange (TV series)|Xchange]]''. This changed in Autumn 2004, when CBBC moved to [[TC1 studio|TC9]] following the normal CBBC links move to [[TC1 studio|TC1]]0; however, this was changed in March 2006 so that all CBBC and CBBC channel links were located in TC9. A further change was to take place in December 2006 when all output moved to a [[Chroma key]] set within [[TC1 studio|TC1]]2, and was presented by only one presenter. This short live decision lasted until the relaunch in 2007, which involved a new 'office' set being constructed, initially in TC12 and then in a new studio facility in the East Tower of Television Centre.

In 2011, CBBC moved to [[MediaCityUK]], and has been presented from there since September 2011. The Office has been through a number of revamps since then, two in 2015, the first one being a minor change because of the Go CBBC app, and another one in May which entirely changed some of the structure, adding a post chute and an Up Next screen, and one so far in 2016, due to CBBC's new look, gaining a smaller desk, an extra Up Next screen, and renaming it 'CBBC HQ'.

==Other services==
===CBBC Extra===
CBBC Extra is a free interactive television service from CBBC provided by the [[BBC Red Button]]. It is accessible from CBBC by pressing red and then selecting CBBC Extra from the main menu. It can also be accessed from any other BBC channel by pressing red and going to page number 570. The service differs across digital platforms, for example [[Sky (United Kingdom)|Sky]] viewers can access a video loop. After a brief stint with a temporary producer the channel really took off under producer and director Brendan Sheppard who spearheaded its success. After Sheppard had finished work on the BAFTA nominated ''Nelly Nut Live'' he was asked by CBBC controller Gary August to work on CBBC Extra and under Sheppard the show received a new brand look, idents, graphics and it introduced feature items such as Ask Aaron and a Halloween special with Basil Brush, there was a ''Doctor Who'' special with sequences featuring K9 that had to be cut at the last minute and a documentary series called ''Really Living It!'' Sheppard was then asked to direct ''DinoSapien'' in Canada and a new producer was installed with Sheppard later moving on to ''Doctor Who''. Its availability on [[Freeview (UK)|Freeview]] is dependent upon [[BBC Red Button]] not showing other interactive services, such as major sports events coverage.<ref>{{cite news|publisher=CBBC |access-date=21 May 2007 |date=21 May 2007 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/cbbc/content/articles/2005/11/09/otherservices_cbbcextra_feature.shtml |title=CBBC- CBBC extra |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070222002619/http://www.bbc.co.uk/cbbc/content/articles/2005/11/09/otherservices_cbbcextra_feature.shtml |archive-date=22 February 2007 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> The service offers numerous features including ''[[Newsround]]'', horoscopes, Chris/Dodge's blog, viewer content and jokes and other interactive elements.

As of May 2016, CBBC Extra was closed down along with its rebrand.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/cbbc/topics/cbbc-extra-behind-the-scenes |title=CBBC Extra |publisher=BBC |access-date=29 January 2014 |archive-date=13 November 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131113040310/http://www.bbc.co.uk/cbbc/topics/cbbc-extra-behind-the-scenes |url-status=dead }}</ref>

===CBBC Online===
{{main|BBC Online}}
The CBBC website provides a wide range of activities for viewers aged 6–15, such as games, videos, puzzles, printable pages, pre-moderated message boards and frequently updated news feeds. It contains pages for the majority of its current programming with various content on each. There are also micro-sites from ''[[Newsround]]'' and ''[[MOTD Kickabout]]'', providing children with news and sport, as well as the CBBC on [[BBC iPlayer]] to replay CBBC programmes for up to thirty days.

===CBBC HD===
In July 2013, BBC announced that CBBC HD would be launched by early 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-23326709|title=BBC to launch five new HD channels|date=16 July 2013|work=BBC News|access-date=16 July 2013}}</ref> The channel launched on 10 December 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2013/new-hd-channels.html|title=BBC to launch five new subscription-free HD channels on Tuesday 10 December|date=9 December 2013|publisher=BBC|access-date=9 December 2013|archive-date=11 December 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131211204948/http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2013/new-hd-channels.html|url-status=dead}}</ref> CBBC HD broadcasts on the BBC's existing HD multiplex on Freeview and shares its stream with [[BBC Three|BBC Three HD]] as they air at different times.

Before launch, the majority of CBBC HD output was broadcast on [[BBC HD]] before its closure in March 2013. CBBC HD was added to the Sky EPG in Ireland in 2017.

From July to August 2014, CBBC HD was temporarily removed from Freeview during the [[2014 Commonwealth Games]] to let [[BBC Three]] and BBC Three HD broadcast 24 hours a day, similar to how [[BBC Parliament]] was removed during the [[2008 Summer Olympics]] and [[2012 Summer Olympics]].

From March to April 2018, CBBC HD used downtime mode to let [[BBC Red Button HD]] broadcast 9 pm to 5:30 am on Sky and Freeview. After the close, CBBC HD began to use 24 hours again.

Since BBC Scotland launched, CBBC HD  finishes at 19:00 in Scotland on Freeview, due to its timesharing with BBC Scotland HD, which starts at 19:00, however, CBBC SD still finishes at 21:00 in Scotland.

===CBBC Alba===
In September 2018 as part of a branding strategy, the unbranded 2-hour children's block on [[BBC Alba]] was split into [[CBeebies|CBeebies Alba]] and CBBC Alba, with the former airing during the first hour and the latter airing during the second hour. This block features its own presentation, presenters and shows all dubbed into [[Scottish Gaelic]].

Previously, a similar block called ''Children's BBC Scotland'' was aired in the Scottish school holidays throughout the 1990s. The block consisted of repeats and local programming as well as regional versions of the summer holiday mid-morning slot and the Children's BBC Breakfast Show.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VewFEow48ps|title = CBBC Scotland ident - Mouse|website = [[YouTube]]}}</ref>

==International versions==
===Australia===
On 15 March 2021, it was announced by Australian provider Fetch TV that they would launch a channel called "[[BBC Kids (Australian TV channel)|BBC Kids]]"<ref name="fetch">{{Cite web|last=Brzoznowski|first=Kristin|date=22 March 2021|title=BBC Kids to Launch on Fetch in Australia|url=https://worldscreen.com/tvkids/bbc-kids-to-launch-on-fetch-in-australia/|access-date=6 April 2021|website=TVKIDS|language=en-US}}</ref> (unrelated to a Canadian [[BBC Kids|BBC-branded channel of the same name]]) on 24 April 2021 to replace [[Cartoon Network (Australian and New Zealand TV channel)|Cartoon Network]] and [[Boomerang (Australian and New Zealand TV channel)|Boomerang]]. It is essentially a version of CBBC for the country, as it's aimed at the same target audience as CBBC and airs children's programmes from the [[BBC Studios]] catalogue.

==History==
===Launch===
The CBeebies channel was launched on 11 February 2002 alongside the [[CBBC (TV channel)|CBBC channel]], as a spinoff from [[BBC Children's and Education|the BBC's children's television strand]]. The first four shows to air on the channel were ''[[Teletubbies]]'', ''[[Pingu]]'', ''[[Binka]]'', and ''[[Step Inside]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2002/feb/11/broadcasting.bbc|title=What Auntie did next|author=Maggie Brown|date=11 February 2002|access-date=4 April 2016|work=The Guardian}}</ref> CBeebies domestically broadcasts from 6 am to 7 pm each 6 day sunday to friday, and as a result, it timeshares with fellow BBC channel [[BBC Four]], which is on air after this channel goes off air for the day.<ref>{{cite web|title=CBeebies – what we do|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/commissioning/tv/articles/cbeebies|work=BBC|access-date=4 April 2016}}</ref>

The station was joined in March 2007<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/search/0/20?order=asc&q=cbeebies&svc=9371564#search|title=Search Results – BBC Genome|website=genome.ch.bbc.co.uk|access-date=21 July 2017}}</ref> by an audio ''CBeebies Radio'', which broadcast for three hours each day on [[BBC Radio 4 Extra|BBC Radio 7]] until April 2011. CBeebies Radio, however, has continued as a feature on CBeebies' website since 2013, and as a station on [[BBC Sounds]] broadcasting from 6 am to 10 pm. A magazine called ''CBeebies Weekly'' was first published in 2006.

Since March 2013, CBeebies has been carried by the [[British Forces Broadcasting Service]], sharing a channel with BFBS Extra.<ref>[http://www.bfbs.com/tv/node/823536 BFBS TV IS CHANGING] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121017201105/http://www.bfbs.com/tv/node/823536 |date=17 October 2012 }}</ref> CBeebies is also available in Ireland.

==International and non-English versions==
[[BBC Studios]] owns and operates the international CBeebies feeds, with most of them operating on a 24-hour schedule.

The first international launch for the CBeebies channel was in [[India]] in May 2007, although the channel was withdrawn at the end of November 2012 due to "commercial considerations".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/indiarealtime/2012/11/02/bbc-pulls-plug-on-two-india-channels/|title=BBC Pulls Plug on Two India Channels|author=Will Davies|work=WSJ}}</ref> The [[Poland|Polish]] CBeebies channel was launched on 2 December 2007, while feeds in [[Latin America]], [[East Asia|East]] and [[Southeast Asia]], [[South Africa]], and [[Australia]] were launched in 2008. In March 2011, the [[video on demand|on demand]] version of the network was launched in the US and is available on [[Xfinity]].

On 13 May 2011, CBeebies was launched as a programme block on the channel [[BBC Kids]] in [[Canada]], available on weekdays between 9:00&nbsp;am and 3:00&nbsp;pm. It served a similar schedule to the main channel. The block ceased alongside its main channel on 31 December 2018, with some programmes moving to [[Knowledge Network]].

In April 2015, BBC Worldwide signed with [[South Korea]]n broadcaster [[Korean Broadcasting System|KBS]] and [[Japan]]ese broadcaster [[Kids Station]] to launch CBeebies blocks on both channels.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/worldwide/2015/cbeebies-programming-blocks|title = BBC Worldwide signs deals to launch CBeebies programming blocks in South Korea and Japan}}</ref>

In April 2016, a channel for the [[MENA]] region was launched.

On 5 April 2018, a feed was launched on [[Digiturk]] in [[Turkey]].

In September 2018 as part of a branding strategy, the unbranded 2-hour children's block on BBC Alba was split into CBeebies Alba and [[CBBC (TV channel)#CBBC Alba|CBBC Alba]], with the former airing during the first hour and the latter airing during the second hour. This block features its own presentation, presenters and shows all dubbed into [[Scottish Gaelic]].

On 1 December 2019, the Australian feed launched in [[New Zealand]] on [[Sky (New Zealand)|Sky]].

In July 2020, it was relaunched in India,<ref>{{Cite news|last=Editor|first=TVA|date=July 2020|title=CBeebies pre-school channel returns to India|work=Television Asia|url=https://tva.onscreenasia.com/2020/07/cbeebies-pre-school-channel-returns-to-india|url-status=live|access-date=19 January 2021}}</ref> but with pan-Asian feed in English [[Sound multiplex in broadcasting|audio track]] only.

On 31 October 2020, CBeebies (On Demand Content) and Cbeebies en Español (Spanish Live TV Channel and On Demand Content) ceased U.S. operations and were no longer available through any US Satellite, Cable, and Streaming provider (Dish Network, Xfinity, Sling TV, etc.)<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.xfinity.com/support/articles/cbeeies-en-espanol-unavailable|title=CBeebies and CBeebies en Español No Longer Available After October 31, 2020|date=24 June 2021}}</ref> However, CBeebies can also be available as a non-Spanish channel

==Management==
In the UK, CBeebies is operated by the [[BBC Children's and Education]] division and part of [[BBC North]]. The division is also responsible for CBBC and overall strategic responsibility for all of the BBC's domestic services for children rests with the [[List of directors of BBC Children's|Director of Children's and Education]], Patricia Hildago Reina (since 2020).<ref>{{Cite web|last1=Dams|first1=Tim|date=2020-05-05|title=BBC Names Turner's Patricia Hidalgo as Director of Children's and Education|url=https://variety.com/2020/tv/news/bbc-turner-patricia-hidalgo-childrens-education-1234598141/|access-date=2021-02-11|website=Variety|language=en-US}}</ref> The direction of the domestic CBeebies channel itself rested with [[Kay Benbow]], the last Controller of the channel commissioning all CBeebies content across BBC television, online, interactive TV, and radio.<ref>{{cite web|title=Biography – Kay Benbow|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/biographies/biogs/controllers/kay_benbow.shtml|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111012171039/https://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/biographies/biogs/controllers/kay_benbow.shtml|archive-date=12 October 2011|access-date=16 October 2011|publisher=BBC Press Office}}</ref> She took over from the first controller [[Michael Carrington (television executive)|Michael Carrington]] in 2010.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/jan/27/cbeebies-michael-carrington-bbc-turner |title=Carrington Leaves BBC |date=27 January 2010|work= by Mark Sweney, guardian.co.uk }}</ref> In 2017 it was announced that the CBeebies controller post would close in December 2017 and all content for the CBeebies brand would be commissioned by a new, pan BBC Children's role entitled Head of Content.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tbivision.com/news/2017/07/benbow-exiting-bbc-childrens-shake/776711/|title=Benbow exiting in BBC Children's shake-up – TBI Vision – Page 776711|website=tbivision.com|date=25 July 2017}}</ref>   In January 2021 it was announced that the decision would be reversing and a new Head of Commissioning and Acquisitions for preschoolers (0–6) would be appointed.<ref>{{Cite web|title=BBC Children's shuffles responsibilities|url=https://kidscreen.com/2021/02/05/bbc-childrens-shuffles-responsibilities/|access-date=2021-02-11}}</ref>

Internationally, CBeebies is owned by [[BBC Studios]], which operate the brand.

==Presentation==
The links between programmes on CBeebies are primarily achieved through the use of [[Continuity (broadcasting)|in-vision continuity]], using presenters to interact with the children. In the UK, links are recorded rather than broadcast live, as is the case on sister channel CBBC. They were originally recorded from studio TC0 at [[Television Centre, London|BBC Television Centre]] in London, but moved out in 2008 to [[Teddington Studios]], and returned briefly in 2010. From September 2011, the links have been based at the BBC's northern base at [[Dock10 (television facility)|Dock10]], [[MediaCityUK]] following the move of the BBC Children's department there. International variants feature broadcast links produced either in the corresponding country or from a central base.

===Logo and identities===
{{main|CBBC idents}}

{{see also|History of BBC television idents}}
uses many identities throughout the day during the breaks in between shows. Most of these idents feature the mascots, named the Bugs, also known as Bugbies. The Bugbies are yellow blobs with faces. Most idents feature children saying twice once the logo appears except the bedtime ones.  idents have used a moving blobby, slimy-like background or rounded shapes in any colour. Each block has its own ident, and the bedtime hour has a few different idents. In 2007, new idents were made for each block, replacing the old ones and the slimy moving background idents were rarely shown. New idents featuring house have been used too.

===Presenters===
A number of presenters fill the gaps between the shows, speaking directly to the child, leading activities based on a topic from the website, showing viewers' birthday cards, and introducing the shows, well as hosting some of the shows. Many of the presenters have histories as characters on other services or on children's programmes.

===Stranded segments===
{{overly detailed|section|date=August 2014}}
In the UK, the CBeebies channel uses stranded segments throughout the day.

On 10 March 2003,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/schedules/cbeebies/2003-03-10#at-18.00|title=CBeebies – 10 March 2003 – BBC Genome|website=genome.ch.bbc.co.uk}}</ref> a segment called the Bedtime Hour was aired.

From 3 April<ref>{{cite web|url=http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/schedules/cbeebies/2004-04-03#at-13.00|title=CBeebies – 3 April 2004 – BBC Genome|website=genome.ch.bbc.co.uk}}</ref> to 19 December 2004, each weekend afternoon was divided into five segments, which were presented by one of the then-current presenters, namely [[Chris Jarvis (presenter)|Chris Jarvis]], [[Nicole Davis (presenter)|Nicole Davis]], [[Pui Fan Lee]], [[Sidney Sloane]], and [[Sue Monroe]]. Each was given a core theme (for instance Sid's segment included "building and making" programmes such as ''[[Bob the Builder]]'', Sue's included arts and crafts theme programmes and so on). The five segments aired from 1:00&nbsp;pm until 6:00&nbsp;pm; the segmentation was later dispensed in December 2004, although the presenters still wore their respective colours for several months afterwards. They also cropped up in props used in links, such as coloured plates.

The five coloured room sections ran from 1:00&nbsp;pm to 6:00&nbsp;pm and included:
* '''Pui's Exploring Hour (Red Room)''', with programmes such as ''[[Come Outside]]'',  ''[[Teletubbies|Teletubbies Everywhere]]'', ''[[Tots TV]]'', ''[[Boo! (TV series)|Boo!]]'',  ''[[Bits and Bobs]]'' and ''[[Fab Lab]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/search/0/20?adv=0&q=Pui's+Exploring+Hour&media=all&yf=1923&yt=2009&mf=1&mt=12&tf=00:00&tt=00:00#search|title=Search Results – BBC Genome|website=genome.ch.bbc.co.uk}}</ref>
* '''Sid's Fix-It Hour (Green Room)''', with programmes such as ''[[Bob the Builder]]'', ''[[Fireman Sam]]'', ''[[Little Robots]]'', and ''[[Postman Pat]]'' <ref>{{cite web|url=http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/search/0/20?adv=0&q=Sid's+Fix+It+Hour&media=all&yf=1923&yt=2009&mf=1&mt=12&tf=00:00&tt=00:00#search|title=Search Results – BBC Genome|website=genome.ch.bbc.co.uk}}</ref>

* '''Sue's Make and Do Hour (Pink Room)''', with programmes such as ''[[SMarteenies]]'', ''[[Big Cook, Little Cook]]'', ''[[Pingu]]'' and ''[[Tikkabilla]]'' <ref>{{cite web|url=http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/search/0/20?adv=0&q=Make+and+do+hour&media=all&yf=1923&yt=2009&mf=1&mt=12&tf=00:00&tt=00:00#search|title=Search Results – BBC Genome|website=genome.ch.bbc.co.uk}}</ref>
* '''Nicole's Furry Friends Hour (Orange Room)''', with programmes such as ''[[Clifford the Big Red Dog (2000 TV series)|Clifford the Big Red Dog]]'', ''[[Binka]]'',  ''[[The Koala Brothers]]'', ''[[Angelmouse]]'',  ''[[Becky and Barnaby Bear|Barnaby Bear]]''  and ''[[The Magic Key]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/search/0/20?q=Furry+Friends+&svc=9371512#search|title=Search Results – BBC Genome|website=genome.ch.bbc.co.uk}}</ref>

A new strand entitled the Carrot Club was introduced in 2003, which had a female voiceover presenting where we are shown to toddlers running around and playing with toys. A new strand entitled Pic and Play was shown for the first time in June 2004,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/search/0/20?order=asc&q=pick+and+play&svc=9371512#search|title=Search Results – BBC Genome|website=genome.ch.bbc.co.uk|access-date=21 July 2017}}</ref> in which viewers contacted CBeebies via the website and other means to suggest programmes they would like to see. Also, in September 2005,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/search/0/20?order=asc&q=bear+and+butterfly&svc=9371512#search|title=Search Results – BBC Genome|website=genome.ch.bbc.co.uk|access-date=21 July 2017}}</ref> a new strand called Bear and Butterfly launched, showing on weekend mornings. Presented by a cartoon bear (voiced by [[Chris Jarvis (presenter)|Chris Jarvis]]) and butterfly (voiced by [[Sue Monroe]]), and with an occasional appearance from a caterpillar, the characters interacted in an animated environment. They also showed pictures that had been sent in on their Message Tree.

New strands were introduced on 3 April 2006; Get Set Go From 7.00am (Currently 6.00am) to 9.00am Explorers from 9:00&nbsp;am to 10:00&nbsp;am and 1:00&nbsp;pm to 2:00&nbsp;pm, Busy Beebies from 10:00&nbsp;am to 11:45&nbsp;am and 2:00&nbsp;pm to 3:45&nbsp;pm, Story Corner from 11:45&nbsp;am to 12:00&nbsp;pm and 3:45&nbsp;pm to 4:00&nbsp;pm and Little Lunchers from 12:00&nbsp;pm to 1:00&nbsp;pm. The Bedtime Hour was retained.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/schedules/cbeebies/2006-04-03|title=CBeebies – 3 April 2006 – BBC Genome|website=genome.ch.bbc.co.uk|access-date=21 July 2017}}</ref>

On 19 March 2007,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/mar/19/mondaymediasection9|title=Doing it for the kids|last=Rouse|first=Lucy|date=19 March 2007|work=The Guardian|access-date=21 July 2017|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> these segments were dropped (apart from Get Set Go and Bedtime Hour) and modified to denote the time of day and the levels of activity, including:

* '''Get Set Go''' – Early morning schedule between 6:00am (Originally 7.00am until March 18, 2007) and 9:00am; and given longer hours.  Includes programmes such as ''[[Baby Jake]]'', ''[[Raa Raa the Noisy Lion]]'', ''[[Postman Pat]]'', ''[[Bing (TV series)|Bing]]'',  ''[[Hey Duggee]]'', ''[[Tinpo]]'', ''[[Monty the Dog]]'', ''[[Biggleton]]'', ''[[Justin's House]]'', ''[[Octonauts]]'' and ''[[Go Jetters]]''.
* '''Discover and Do''' – Late morning and early afternoon, weekdays between 9:00&nbsp;am and 3:00&nbsp;pm. The strand is aimed at young children who would not be attending school or pre-school. It often contains programmes that give a learning opportunity to viewers, such as ''[[Something Special (TV series)|Something Special]]'', ''[[Teletubbies]]'', ''B.O.T. And the Beasties'', ''[[Let's Play (TV series)|Let's Play]]'', ''Andy's Baby Animals'', ''[[Topsy and Tim]]'',    ''[[Alphablocks]]'', ''[[Twirlywoos]]'', ''[[Numberblocks]]'' and ''Yakka Dee''. The hour between 12:00&nbsp;pm and 1:00&nbsp;pm is branded as '''Lunch Time''' and features shows such as ''My World Kitchen'', ''[[Molly and Mack]]'' & Patchwork Pals.
* '''Big Fun Time''' – Late afternoon weekdays between 3:00pm and 5:45pm. This strand is notable for aiming at the higher end of its remit, airing programming for children who have recently returned from school. Programmes include ''[[ZingZillas]]'',  ''[[The Furchester Hotel]]'', ''[[Swashbuckle (TV series)|Swashbuckle]]'',  ''[[Do You Know? (TV series)|Do You Know?]]'', ''Andy's Safari Adventures'', ''[[Apple Tree House]]'', ''[[Grace's Amazing Machines]]'',''[[Bitz & Bob]]'', ''[[Waffle the Wonder Dog]]'' & ''[[Gigglebiz]]''. 
* '''Bedtime''' – The final hour and 15 minutes of CBeebies broadcasting between 5:45&nbsp;pm and 7:00&nbsp;pm. The original stranded section of the channel (and the only to still air to this day), Bedtime helps to prepare children for bed and features calm-natured programming. Programmes include ''[[Clangers]]'',  ''Moon and Me'', ''[[Charlie and Lola (TV series)|Charlie and Lola]]'', ''[[Tee and Mo]]'', ''[[Sarah & Duck]]'', ''[[Waybuloo]]'' and ''[[In the Night Garden...]].'' Story-telling is often told during the programmes. The final programme is always the ''Bedtime Stories'' slot (see below) and is followed by a final song, "The Time Has Come to Say Goodnight", before the channel closes for the day and [[BBC Four]] starts up. CBeebies Bedtime was renamed from Bedtime Hour as of 4 February 2019.

When these segments were initially introduced, each segment featured its own presenting team and set, with [[Chris Jarvis (presenter)|Chris Jarvis]] and [[Pui Fan Lee]] ([[Alex Winters]] and [[Cerrie Burnell]] after they left in January 2009) presenting '''Discover and Do''' in the CBeebies "living room"; '''Lunch Time''' in the "kitchen"; '''Bedtime Hour''' in the "bedroom"; [[Sidney Sloane]] (plus [[Andy Day]] when he joined the channel later in 2007) presenting '''Get, Set, Go!''' in the "living room" and '''Big Fun Time''' in the "garage". However, since moving production to Manchester this is no longer the case, with the exception of '''Bedtime Hour''' which is presented from the area nearest the house's bed.

===Storytimes===
While the lunchtime story is usually read by one of the regular presenters, the final show of each day, the ''Bedtime Story'' (known as ''Stòiridh'' in [[Scottish Gaelic]] and airing on [[BBC Alba]]) is read by a guest storyteller, including well known actors, comedians, singers/musicians, and past presenters of BBC children's television (Like [[Derek Jacobi|Sir Derek Jacobi]] who narrated all 100 episodes of 2007's ''[[In the Night Garden...]]'' when he appeared in April 2018 and again in June 2018). Some notable storytellers in this slot have included [[David Walliams]], [[James McAvoy]], [[Simon Pegg]], [[David Hasselhoff]], [[Damian Lewis]], [[Rosamund Pike]], [[Joanna Page]], [[Greg James]], [[Toby Stephens]], [[David Tennant]], [[Ben Faulks]], [[Michael Rosen]], [[Floella Benjamin]], [[Shayne Ward]], [[Romesh Ranganathan]], [[Chris Evans (actor)|Chris Evans]], [[Tom Hardy]], [[David Schwimmer]], [[Dolly Parton]], [[Elton John|Sir Elton John]], [[Rick Astley]], [[Björn Ulvaeus]] of [[ABBA]], [[Ed Sheeran]] and [[Dave Grohl]]. The ''Bedtime Story'' is on every night at 6:50pm for eight minutes before CBeebies goes off air and BBC Four begins programming at 7:00pm.

In an unusual move, [[James Bolam]] appeared on "Bedtime Story" in costume and in character as Grandpa from ''[[Grandpa in My Pocket]]'', not as himself. Another moment like this happened in July 2020, when [[Gemma Hunt]] appeared as her character in Swashbuckle, Gem, as well as various stories read by [[Justin Fletcher]] in character as Mr. Tumble from [[Something Special (TV series)|Something Special]], however Justin has hosted various stories out of character in the past.

===CBBC Presents===
'''CBBC Presents''' is a television programme that bring Live Children's theatre to TV, typically on CBBC or [[RTE One]]. Some of their recent work includes ''The Snow Queen'', ''Hansel and Gretel'', ''Thumbelina'' and ''Christmas in Storyland''.

==CBeebies HD==

The channel launched on 10 December 2013, though was rolled-out nationwide up to June 2014 (as did [[BBC News (TV channel)|BBC News HD]] and [[BBC Four|BBC Four HD]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2013/new-hd-channels.html|title=BBC to launch five new subscription-free HD channels on Tuesday 10 December|work=BBC|date=9 December 2013|access-date=9 December 2013|archive-date=11 December 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131211204948/http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2013/new-hd-channels.html|url-status=dead}}</ref> The channel broadcasts on a commercially operated HD multiplex on Freeview, with limited geographic coverage compared with other multiplexes, and shares its stream with [[BBC Four|BBC Four HD]] as they air at different times. Prior to launch, the majority of CBeebies' HD output was broadcast on [[BBC HD]] before its closure on 26 March 2013.

==Other ventures==

===CBeebies website===
{{see also|BBC Online}}

The CBeebies website coincided with the launch of the UK channel in February 2002 and showcases a child friendly site with activities themed to all CBeebies programmes, past and present, with games, songs and print-outs featuring for nearly all shows. The UK version also features links to [[BBC iPlayer|CBeebies iPlayer]], a child friendly version of the [[BBC iPlayer]] featuring CBeebies programmes only, to CBeebies radio player and a dedicated micro site containing advice for raising children and toddlers called CBeebies Grown-ups, which was relaunched in 2011.<ref>{{cite web|title=CBeebies Website Home Page|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/cbeebies/|access-date=11 October 2009|work=BBC}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2002/20020610/login/cyber.htm|title=BBC's CBeebies|date=10 June 2002|publisher=[[The Tribune (Chandigarh)|Tribune India]]|access-date=11 October 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|date=15 February 2002|title=Beeb's a Boon for the Kids|work=The [[Daily Mirror]]|publisher=[[Trinity Mirror]]|location=London, UK|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/archive/web-gadets/2002/02/15/beeb-s-a-boon-for-the-kids-115875-11620677/|url-status=dead|access-date=11 October 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605024710/https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/archive/web-gadets/2002/02/15/beeb-s-a-boon-for-the-kids-115875-11620677/|archive-date=5 June 2011}}</ref>

The international channels and associated websites are run by [[BBC Studios]]. As a result, not all of them are the same and some channels have less extensive websites than other services. CBeebies channels in Asia, Australia, Poland, South Africa and the USA all have their own international variant.

===VHS and DVD releases===
[[BBC Video]] (and later [[2Entertain]]) have released several VHS/DVD compilations featuring shows airing on CBeebies at the time. As of 2014, [[Abbey Home Media]] releases the compilations.

===Album releases===
Five CBeebies-branded CDs have been released, 'CBeebies: The Official Album' in 2002, 'My CBeebies Album' in 2006, 'My CBeebies Album (Christmas Edition)' in 2007, 'CBeebies: Song Time' in 2010, and 'CBeebies: The Album' in 2012.{{citation needed|date=June 2020}}

===CBeebies Land===
CBeebies Land opened in May 2014. Designed as a retheme of the previous Storybook Land and Old McDonald's Farmyard areas of the [[Alton Towers|Alton Towers Resort]] theme park, it contains a range of themed rides, attractions and live entertainment based around various popular CBeebies programmes. It offers various indoor and outdoor activities aimed at making an immersive and interactive world for children and young families.

The site based within [[Alton Towers|Alton Towers Resort]] in [[Staffordshire]] includes some of the more popular characters from the original channel for guests to meet. Described as a 'fun environment for pre-schoolers to play and learn' by critics.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://press.altontowers.com/news-alton-towers-resort-to-launch-world%E2%80%99s-first-ever-cbeebies-land-as-merlin-and-bbc-worldwide-link-up-11807 |title=Alton Towers Resort Press Centre |publisher=Press.altontowers.com |access-date=6 June 2014}}</ref> Before CBeebies Land, Alton Towers did not have enough rides suitable for young children and since opening CBeebies Land now makes visiting Alton Towers exciting for younger children.

At the start of the year, the theme park sporadically released information on the characters involved in the development via their Facebook and Twitter accounts.

* On 4 January, Mr Tumble was the first character confirmed – featuring in the Something Special Sensory Garden<ref>{{cite web|title=CBeebies Land – Tijdlijnfoto's|url=https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=273942372756982&set=a.248088802009006.1073741828.210110529140167&type=1|access-date=6 June 2014|website=[[Facebook]]|publisher=Facebook}}</ref> and 5 January saw Mr. Bloom confirmed as featuring in the development in the form of Mr Bloom's [[Allotment (gardening)|Allotments]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=273949832756236&set=a.248088802009006.1073741828.210110529140167&type=1 |title=CBeebies Land – Tijdlijnfoto's |publisher=Facebook |access-date=6 June 2014}}</ref>
* On 6 January, the park revealed an ''[[In the Night Garden...]]'' redesign of their existing Riverbank Eyespy. On the re-themed attraction, In the Night Garden Magical Boat Ride, guests will be able to drift around the 'enchanted dreamworld'; an area that will use colours, sights and sounds to bring picture books to life. Iggle Piggle, Makka Pakka and Upsy Daisy will all be on the Night Garden Island to help children appreciate the values of diversity, and enjoy the wonder in the world around them.

Stephen Gould, commercial director at DHX Media who licence ''[[In the Night Garden...]]'' commented, "We are extremely excited to be working in partnership with [[BBC Worldwide]], [[Merlin Entertainments]] and [[Alton Towers|Alton Towers Resort]] on this new venture. In The Night Garden is the ideal draw brand to provide a fun, nurturing, inspiring and immersive environment for CBeebies Land and its visitors."<ref>{{cite web|date=6 January 2014|title=TowersTimes.co.uk: Alton Towers: Park News|url=http://old.towerstimes.co.uk/news/news.php?subaction=showfull&id=1389017158&archive=&start_from=&ucat=1,12&|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150630055356/http://old.towerstimes.co.uk/news/news.php?subaction=showfull&id=1389017158&archive=&start_from=&ucat=1%2C12&|archive-date=30 June 2015|access-date=6 June 2014|publisher=Old.towerstimes.co.uk}}</ref>

The latest addition to CBeebies Land for the 2019 season are two drop towers located next to the Mr Bloom's Allotment attraction. On 1 March 2019, it was confirmed that the drop towers would be named ''Peter Rabbit Hippity Hop''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.altontowers.com/cbeebies-land/2019/|title=CBeebies Land {{!}} New Attractions in 2019|website=www.altontowers.com|language=en|access-date=12 November 2019}}</ref> They are a relocation of the Hip & Hop drop towers at the Sea Life Adventure Park, Oberhausen, Germany.
